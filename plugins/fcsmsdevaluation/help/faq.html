 <a name="FAQ_FITSTAT"><b>What do the fit statistics mean, that the FCS-MSD fit plugin calculates?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
 See <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$/fit_statistics.html">Explanation of Fit Statistics</a> for a detailed explanation

  <a name="FAQ_MEMMODELPARAMETERS"><b>How can I determine the parameters like w<sub>xy</sub> or &gamma; for the MSD-models?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  The MSd-models are based on specific FCS fit models, as described in the <a href="fcs_msd.html">main documentation</a>. In addition to the actual MSD, these are parametrized by further values, such as the focus halfwidth $(w_{xy})$, the focus axial ratio $(\gamma)$, or the triplet-fraction $(\theta_{trip})$ and lifetime $(\tau_{trip})$. These values have to be determined externally e.g. by a standard FCS-fit, best using 2-3 diffusing components to model the actual distribution as good as possible. Such an FCS-fit can be done with the plugin <a href="$$plugin_info:help:fcs_fit$$">FCS Curve Fit</a>. See its documentation for further details.

  <a name="FAQ_FILTER_RDRS"><b>How can I filter the list of raw data records, displayed in the plugin screen?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Above the list (rhs of the evaluation window), there are two fields, that allow to filter the displayed RDRs 
<center><a name="faq_pic000"><img src="./pic/faq_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
You can enter a simple filter expression there. then only those files will be displayed, which contain the given expression. As an example, if your project contains a full FCCS measurement with three RDRs per measurement (ACF0,ACF1 and FCCS), but you only want to fit ACF0-RDRs with this evaluation, simply enter ACF0 into the left field. the rhs filter-field allows to exclude all records, that do NOT contain the specified filter string. In addition you can use <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$qf3_qtregexp.html">regular expressions</a> for the filter strings.

  <a name="FAQ_OVERLAY"><b>How can I create an overlay plot of several measured correlation cures?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
Use the tools in the menu <b>Tools | Overlay Plots</b> of the evaluation editor.
  See the <a href="tutorial_overlayplot.html">Tutorial on overlay plots</a> for a step-by-step description.

  <a name="FAQ_FCSTUTORIAL"><b>How do I perform a MSD-Fit for FCS-data with QuickFit?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  See the <a href="tutorial_msd.html">MaxEnt-FCS Tutorial</a> for step-by-step instructions.
  $$note:The plugin starts with a preset MSD-model for 3D confocal FCS. If you data was acquired with a different microscopy scheme, you can choose a different model at the top of the evaluation editor window to accomodate for this!$$

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_DISTRIBUTIONFIT"><b>How do fit general model functions to the obtained MSD-distributions?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
<ol>
    <li>  In recent version of the MSD-FCS plugin, the MaxEnt-distributions are accessible over a general curve-interface to the FCS-raw data records. Therefore you can use the <a href="$$plugin_info:help:curve_fit$$">General Least-Squares Curve-Fit Plugin</a> to fit any model function to these MSDs.
</li>
    <li>The MSD-fit editor allows to fit up to 4 power-law models $(f(\tau)=P_{pre}\cdot D\cdot\tau^\alpha)$ to different parts of the MSD.</li>
