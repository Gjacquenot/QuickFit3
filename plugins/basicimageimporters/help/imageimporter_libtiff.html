	</head>
	<body>
		$$qf_commondoc_header.start$$ $$qf_commondoc_header.end$$ 
		<p>This plugin allows to read image series from TIFF files. The plugin also recognizes and reads files with several color-channels. To open and read these it uses the open source library <a href="http://www.libtiff.org/">libtiff</a>. </p>
		<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> libTIFF is able to read many different types of TIFF images, also many different types of compressions (e.g. JPEG, ZIP/defalte, LZW, ...), but it has one internal limitation: It is not possible to read more than around 60000 images from one single file.</p>
