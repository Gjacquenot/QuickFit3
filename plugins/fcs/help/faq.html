  <a name="FAQ_OFFSET"><b>How can I perform an offset correction for FCS/DLS data?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Often a constant intensity offset is present in FCS measurements (e.g. by detector dark counts), which changes the amplitude (i.e. particle number/concentration) of the autocorrelation curve. This effect can be compensated in two ways:<ol>
	<li>Most fit models allow to enter the measured intensity (usually read from the input data file) and the background intensity. Then they are accounted for by the fit and the corrected particle number/concentration is returned. The <a href="tutorial_background.html">Tutorial:Set background intensities</a> explains, how a background measurement can be used to set the background intensity for several RDRs in the project. </li>
	<li>The raw data itself can be corrected, as described in the <a href="tutorial_offset.html">Tutorial: Correct correlation offset</a>. </li>
  </ol>

  <a name="FAQ_SIM"><b>Is it possible to generate FCS/DLS data from one of the available fit models?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Yes, the <a href="fcs_simulator.html">FCS/DLS Curve Simulator</a> (to be found in the menu entry <tt>Data Items|Insert Raw Data|FCS/DLS data|FCS/DLS Data from fit function</tt>) allows to generate an FCS/DLS raw data record from a given fit model with user-defineable parameters. It also allows to add different types of noise to the data. This function can be used to e.g. test evaluations, or to get a feel for the properties of a fit model and the influence of its parameters on the shape of the correlation function.

  <a name="FAQ_PARSER_CORR"><b>How can I access the correlation curves from the internal expression parser, or the table plugin?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  <p>The FCS plugin provides math parser functions, that allow to access the <a href="./parserreference/fcs.html">correlation curves</a> and the <a href="./parserreference/cr.html">countrate traces</a> of the FCS records in the project. Each FCS RDR contains a set of runs, with one correlation curve $(g_i=g(\tau_i))$ in each. The lag-time axis $(\tau_i)$ is the same for all these curves. You can access the curve with the methods <a href="./parserreference/fcs.html#fcs_tau"><tt>fcs_tau(rdr_id)</tt></a> for the lag times $(\tau_i)$ and <a href="./parserreference/fcs.html#fcs_correlation"><tt>fcs_correlation(rdr_id, run)</tt></a> for the correlation data $(g_i=g(\tau_i))$. In addition the average and standard dveiation correlation curve (over all non-excluded runs) is available via <a href="./parserreference/fcs.html#fcs_meancorrelation"><tt>fcs_meancorrelation(rdr_id)</tt></a> and <a href="./parserreference/fcs.html#fcs_meancorrelationerror"><tt>fcs_meancorrelationerror(rdr_id)</tt></a>.</p>
  <p>The average/standard deviation countrate data (in kHz) can be accessed using <a href="./parserreference/fcs.html#cr_mean"><tt>cr_mean(rdr_id,run,channel)</tt></a> and  <a href="./parserreference/fcs.html#cr_std"><tt>cr_std(rdr_id,run,channel)</tt></a>. The functions <a href="./parserreference/fcs.html#cr_time"><tt>cr_time(rdr_id,run,channel)</tt></a> and  <a href="./parserreference/fcs.html#cr_rate"><tt>cr_rate(rdr_id,run,channel)</tt></a> allow for an access to the whole traces, if they are available in the record.</p>
  <p>You can also access the list of used/non-used runs, by using the functions tp <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$/parserreference/runexclude_access.html">access to excluded runs in RDRs</a>.</p>
  $$note:The functions for correlation curves are also applicable to imagingFCS records. $$
