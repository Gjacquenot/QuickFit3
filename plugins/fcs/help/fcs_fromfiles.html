	 <h2>Open Correlation Data from Files</h2>
	 <p>This plugin allows to open Fluorescence (Cross-)Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) data into QuickFit. These dataformats are readable:
	 <ul>
	   <li>ALV-5000</li>
	   <li>ISS Alba Files</li>
	   <li>ASCII Data Files (e.g. Comma Separated Values)</li>
	 </ul>
	 From a file this plugin loads (possibly several) <b>runs $$math:(\tau_i, g_i=\hat{g}(\tau_i), \sigma_i)_{i=0..R-1}$$</b> which are a list/table of the correlation function $$math:g_i$$ measured at several lag times $$math:\tau_i$$. Also they may possibly contain an estimation error $$math:\signa_i$$ for each value of the correlation function. The plugin averages over the runs to yield the <b>average run (no. -1) $$bmath:\left(\tau_i, \overline{g}_i=\frac{1}{R}\cdot\sum_{i=0}^Rg_i, \sigma_i=\sqrt{\frac{1}{R-1}\cdot\left[\sum_{i=0}^Rg_i^2-\frac{1}{R}\cdot\left(\sum_{i=0}^Rg_i\right)^2\right]}\right)_{i=0..R-1}$$</b>.
	 </p>
	 <p>This plugin also loads intensity traces acquired during the experiments. These may be used to assess the quality of a measurement (have there been agregates, was bleaching present etc.). Also average count rates are extracted that may be used as parameters for some fit models (e.g. to calcuate the counts/molecule in FCS). In principle one count rate curve per correlation run may be loaded, although some file formats (e.g. ALV-5000) only save one curve per measurement. The plugin also performs internal binning to approx. 200 datapoints, if the timetraces have many (>1000) datapoints to improve the speed of display. In that case a binned and the full timetrace may be displayed!</p>

	 <h2>Raw Data Record User Interface</h2>
	 <h3>Tab "Correlation Curves"</h3>
	 In this tab you will see all correlation curves loaded into the current raw data record. On the rhs. you may choose how they are presented to you and see a list of all available runs. There are also buttons to exclude selected runs from the evaluation. These options are available:
	 <ul>
	   <li><b>display average:</b> select a display style for the average over all runs.</li>
	   <li><b>display runs:</b> choose how to display the different runs in the file <ul>
	     <li><i>no runs:</i> displays only the average</li>
	     <li><i>all runs:</i> displays all runs in different colors</li>
	     <li><i>all runs (highlighted):</i> displays all runs in gray, and the selected runs in red</li>
	     <li><i>used runs:</i> displays only those runs that have not been excluded</li>
	     <li><i>selected run:</i> displays only the currently selected run</li>
	   </ul></li>
	   <li><b>run errors:</b> plot styles for the errors</li>
	   <li><b>select runs to display:</b> a list of all runs in the file. Select a run for the "selected run"/"all runs (highlighted)" display modes or to exlude/include a run</li>
	   <li><b>exclude/include run:</b> excludes/includes the currently selected run ("select runs to display" list) from the evaluation. Note that the runs won't be deleted physically from the file, but will rather be marked as "do not use" in the project only. So the input data files are NEVER altered.</li>
	   <li><b>log scale in lag time axis:</b> draws the lag time axis in the plot logarithmically or linearly scaled.</li>
	   <li><b>lower & upper cut-off</b> Here you may cut some correlation channels (i.e. lag times $$math:\tau_i$$) to have a nicer display. This will have no effect in any other plugin in Quickfit and is used for improved local display only!</li>
	   <li><b>Info:</b> displays the number of runs and data points per run in the current raw data record</li>
	   <li><b>Graph/Plot:</b> For information on how to interact with the plot, please see <a href="$$qf_ui_jkqtplotter_helpfile$$">the according online-help page.</a></li>
	   <li>Also see the page "<a href="$$qf_ui_rdr_helpfile$$">$$qf_ui_rdr_helpfiletitle$$</a>" for futher information about UI elements common to all raw data records.

	 <h3>Tab "Photon Counts"</h3>
	 In this tab you will see all intensity time traces loaded into the current raw data record. On the rhs. you may choose how they are presented to you and see a list of all available runs. There are also buttons to exclude selected runs from the evaluation. These options are available:
	 <ul>
	   <li><b>data display mode:</b> <ul>
	     <li><i>binned or none:</i> display the binned timetrace if available or none (does never display the full timetrace)</li>
	     <li><i>binned or full:</i> displays the binned timetrace of available or the full timetrace as a fallback</li>
	     <li><i>full or binned:</i> displays the full timetrace if available or the binned as a fallback</li>
	     <li><i>none:</i> displays no timetrace</li>
	   </ul></li>
	   <li><b>runs display mdoe:</b> choose how to display the different runs in the file <ul>
	     <li><i>all runs:</i> displays all runs in different colors</li>

	     <li><i>used runs:</i> displays only those runs that have not been excluded</li>
	     <li><i>selected run:</i> displays only the currently selected run</li>
	   </ul></li>
	   <li><b>select runs to display:</b> a list of all runs in the file. Select a run for the "selected run"/"all runs (highlighted)" display modes or to exlude/include a run</li>
	   <li><b>exclude/include run:</b> excludes/includes the currently selected run ("select runs to display" list) from the evaluation. Note that the runs won't be deleted physically from the file, but will rather be marked as "do not use" in the project only. So the input data files are NEVER altered.</li>
	   <li><b>display statistics:</b> displays timetrace statistics (mean, std. deviation, min/max rate) as a table below the plot.</li>
	   <li><b>display average in plot:</b> shows average and standard deviation for every countrate curve as a line and translucent range</li>
	   <li><b>include 0 on rate axis:</b> autoscaling the y-axis always includes 0 counts</li>
	   <li><b>overlay other count rates:</b>overlays count rate curves from other loaded FCS files.</li>
	   <li><b>lower & upper cut-off</b> Here you may cut some correlation channels (i.e. lag times $$math:\tau_i$$) to have a nicer display. This will have no effect in any other plugin in Quickfit and is used for improved local display only!</li>
