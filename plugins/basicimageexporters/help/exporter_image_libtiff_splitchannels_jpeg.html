		<title>TIFF exporter with JPEG Compression, 8/16/32-bit, one file per channel</title>
	</head>

		$$qf_commondoc_header.start$$ $$qf_commondoc_header.end$$ 
		<p>This exporter saves an image series into a TIFF file, using lossy JPEG compression. It also splits the channels into separate files. It will create one file <tt>BASENAME_chXX.tif</tt> for each color channel, where <tt>XX</tt> is the channel number (0,1,...) and <tt>BASENAME</tt> is the filename (without extension), which was given by the user. $$note:This exporter will convert 64-bit double-images to a 32-bit float, since 64-bit samples are not supported by all image processing tools (e.g. IMageJ does not support them!)$$</p>
