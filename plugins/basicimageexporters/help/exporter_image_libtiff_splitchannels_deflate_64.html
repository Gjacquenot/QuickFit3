		<p>This exporter saves an image series into a TIFF file, using loss-less ZIP/Deflate compression. It also splits the channels into separate files. It will create one file <tt>BASENAME_chXX.tif</tt> for each color channel, where <tt>XX</tt> is the channel number (0,1,...) and <tt>BASENAME</tt> is the filename (without extension), which was given by the user.</p>
