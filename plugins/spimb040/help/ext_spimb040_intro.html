     <p>This plugin is designed to control the Single Plane Illumination Microscope (SPIM) of the group B040 Biophysics of Macromolecules at the DKFZ. THe image shows the principle of this microscopy type.</p>
	 <p>The plugin supports up to two cameras (of any type that is implemented as QFExtensionCamera plugin in QuickFit) and an XYZ-stage to translate the sample with respect to the lightsheet. In the upper two panels you can <a href="#camconfig">configure the cameras</a> and also the objectives used for illumination and detection. The objective data is used as metadata in the description files saved together with any acquisition data. Below the cameras you can <a href="#stages">configure the stages</a>. In the lower part of the window one pane displays a logging output that is used to show system and error messages from the used components and procedures. Above that some tabs allow to do <a href="#acquisition">acquisitions of different types</a>.</p>
