  <a name="FAQ_EXPORT"><b>How can I export an image stack?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  You can use the general export tool of the image stack plugin, either by right-clicking an image stack RDR in the project tree (in the main window) and choosing <b>Export Data From RDR</b>, or by clicking on the menu entry <b>Record | Export Data</b> in the image stack RDR editor window. In both cases, you will be asked to select a new filename and an export dataformat. Several export formats are available (e.g. several TIFF variants).
