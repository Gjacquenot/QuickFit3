	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This plugin allows to view 2D/3D/4D images. It represents the image stacks as:
	<ul>
	  <li>2D: a single frame (width &times; height) with one color channel</li>
	  <li>3D: a single frame (width &times; height) with several color channels</li>
	  <li>3D: a set of frames (width &times; height) with one color channel</li>
	  <li>4D: a set of frames (width &times; height) with several color channels</li>
	</ul>
	in addition each image stack RDR may contain several separate image stacks.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2>User Interface</h2>
	<h3>Inserting an image stack</h3>
	<p>
	  The plugin can load all image stack files for which a reader plugin is available (by default at least TIFF files). There are several options available in the menu <tt>Raw data Items|Image Stacks</tt>:
	  <ul>
	    <li><img src=":/image_stack/singlefile_stack.png"> <b>Single file image stack</b>: Loads an image stack with a single color channel from a file.  If several files are selected, each file is loaded as a separate image stack RDR.</li>
	    <li><img src=":/image_stack/multifile_stack.png"> <b>Multi file image stack</b>: Loads a multi-channel image stack from several files (select several files when adding this type of RDR). Each file is loaded as a separate color channel.</li>
	    <li><img src=":/image_stack/singlefile_dvh_stack.png"> <b>Horizontal DualView image stack</b>: Loads an image series acquired with a DualView optics imaging the two color channels side by side. Each image half is loaded as a color channel and if several farmes are available in the file, these are loaded as separate frames. If several files are selected, each file is loaded as a separate image stack RDR.</li>
	    <li><img src=":/image_stack/singlefile_dvv_stack.png"> <b>Vertical DualView image stack</b>: Loads an image series acquired with a DualView optics imaging the two color channels above each other. Each image half is loaded as a color channel and if several farmes are available in the file, these are loaded as separate frames. If several files are selected, each file is loaded as a separate image stack RDR.</li>
		
	  </ul>
	</p>
	
    <h3>RDR Editor</h3>
	<p>
	  The RDR editor has one main tab, which displays the image stack. The different color channels can be overlayn in different <b>channel modes</b>:
	  <ul>
	    <li><b>singe channel:</b> Displays a single color channel in false-colors with a selectable color palette. A second channel can be used for the alpha channel to set some pixels invisible.</li>
	    <li><b>4-channel RGBA:</b> Here up to three color channels can be associated with the red green and blue color channel of the final image. A fourth channel can be used for alpha blending.</li>
	  </ul>
	  The slider below the image display allows to move through the iage stack.
	  On the RHS of the image view, a histogram of the pixel values is displayed. It constains all channels currently displayed on the left.
	</p>
	<p>The Menu <tt>Mask</tt> and the widgets above the image plot allow to edit the image mask. With the rectangle, circle, ... tools you can draw selections with the mous (drag with left button) on the image display. It is also possible to select a subset of the pixels.</p>
	
	<h3>3D Viewer</h3>
	This plugin also contains a <a href="3dviewer.html"><img src=":/image_stack/viewer3d.png"> 3D Viewer</a>, which can be started using the menu entry <tt>"Stack Tools | 3D Viewer"</tt>. the viewer display one stack at a time and each channel as a separate volume dataset.
