		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This plugin allows to perform a simple colocalization analysis on a dual-color image stack. It plots the pixel intensitiess into a 2D-correlation plot and calculates correlation coeffciients between the channels.</p>
		
		<h2>User Interface</h2>
		<p><ul>
		  <li>Choose an image stack from the list on the right</li>
		  <li>select the channels, that you want to compare</li>
		  <li>observe the results on the left</li>
		  <li>You can draw a rectangle in the correlation plot with the mouse. When that rectangle is finished, all pixels with values in that parameter region will be highlighted (in blue)n in the overview image.</li>
		  <li>This plugin also calculates Pearson's correlation coefficient between the two color channels for all pixels larger than the background threshold and (optionally) within the user-selected range in the correlation plot. These results are stored as evaluation results (last tab) and displayed in the table, next to the overview plot.</li>
