        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Algorithm</h3>
        <p>The basic steps of this algorithm are:<ol>
          <li>determine initial estimates of the bead positions in the first color channel</li>          
          <li>For each color channel:<ol>
            <li><li>For each initial bead:<ol>
              <li>extract a ROI around the position</li>
              <li>check, whether the bead can be evaluated (distance to border, distance to other beads, ...)</li>              
              <li>fit a <a href="beadscan_psf_gaussian.html">1D Gaussian function</a> along the x-, y- and z-cut through the brightest pixel in the ROI</li>
              <li>fit a <a href="beadscan_psf_gaussian.html">1D Gaussian function</a>s along the x-, y-cut for every z-position in the stack (cuts through the brightest pixel in the ROI). This results in width-profiles along the z-axis $( w_x(z) )$ and $( w_y(z) )$. Then fit the <a href="beadscan_psf_gaussianbeam_width.html">width-profile of a Gaussian beam</a> to the results for the $( w_{x}(z) )$ and $( w_{y}(z) )$.</li>
              <li>fit a <a href="beadscan_psf3d_gaussian.html">3D Gaussian function</a> to the ROI</li>
            </ol></li>
          </ol></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h4>Find Initial Bead Position</h4>
        <p>First the initial bead positions are searched in the first (!!!) color channel:<ul>
          <li>The algorithm steps through the stack wicth a stepsize of <tt>ROI_size_z/4</tt>. For each step:<ul>
            <li><tt>frameQ = quantile(frame, 1-pixels_per_frame/(width*height))</tt></li>
            <li>The image is segmented into pixels, larger and smaller than <tt>frameQ</tt>. The larger pixels are initial possibilities for beads.</li>
            <li><tt>min_distance = ROIS_size_xy/3</tt></li>
            <li>calculate the distance matrix $( d_{i,j}=\sqrt{\left(x_i-x_j\right)^2 + \left(y_i-y_j\right)^2} )$ between all initial bead positions</li>
            <li>Go through the found beads:<ul>
              <li>Determine the number of beads in the vicinity (<tt>&lt; min_distance</tt>) of the bead</li>
              <li>If there is only one pixel, then we will use this position as possible bead (center of the ROI). Ignore this bead for the next steps.</li>
              <li>If there are more beads, use the brightest pixel as position as possible bead (center of the ROI). Ignore all beads for the next steps.</li>
            </ul></li>
          </ul></li>
        </ul>
		$$note:Masks, set in the image stack RDR are taken into account at all steps of this evaluation.$$

        <h3>Recipe for gel with beads for lightsheet microscopy (LSFM/SPIM)</h3>
        <p>
        <p>Pepare a gel containing a low concentration of sub-diffractive beads. We use:
      </p><ol>
      <li>Prepare a few 1ml syringes by cutting off the top, where the syringe gets thinner (see image (A) below).</li>
      <li>0.5% PhytaGel (<a href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/p8169?lang=de&amp;region=DE">P8169, Sigma-Aldrich</a>) mixed with deionized water (shake thoroughly). Then heat in the microwave until the gellant dissolves completely. <br><small><i>We use 40ml water and 200&mu;g PhytaGel.</i></small></li>
      <li>Add MgSO<sub>4</sub> to an end concentration of 0.1%<br><small><i>We use 400&mu;l of a 10% MgSO<sub>4</sub> stock solution.</i></small></li>
      <li>While still &gt;40&deg;C, fill 1 ml of the solution into an Epi and add 5-10&mu;l of 100nm TetraSpec beads (<a href="https://products.invitrogen.com/ivgn/product/T7279?ICID=search-product">T-7279 from Invitrogen</a>)
 directly from stock. Vortex shortly. You can also use any other type of
 bead, as long as the concentration is so low, that the beads are well 
separated in the gel!</li>
      <li>pull up ~300-400&mu;l from one Epi into a syringe (see image (C-D)) and refrigerate for 5min. at 4&deg;C until the gel solidifies</li>
      <li>Measure a beadscan with 1000-2000 frames, displaced by ~200nm. 
Take care to measure in the front part of the gel, so it does not alter 
the optical properties of the microscope too much!</li>

        <h2>User Interface</h2>
        <p>
          $$see:Also see the <a href="tutorial.html">Tutorials</a> for this plugin.$$
          <ol>
            <li>Select an RDR to evaluate on the list on the right</li>
            <li>Set all parameters for the evaluation on the rhs between the results plots and the RDR list:<ul>
                <li><b>pixel size</b>: the pixel size of your camera in nanometers</li>
                <li><b>step size</b>: step size of the image stack in nanometers</li>
                <li><b>ROI lateral (xy)</b>: size of the ROI in x/y-direction, cut around each pixel in pixels. This should be at least 2-3 times larger than the expected PSF size in pixels and at least 5 pixels.</li>
                <li><b>ROI longitudinal (z)</b>: size of the ROI in z-direction, cut around each pixel in pixels. This should be at least 2-3 times larger than the expected PSF size in pixels and at least 5 pixels.</li>
                <li><b>bead search: pix/frame</b>: This is the number of pixels <tt>pixels_per_frame</tt>, that is assumed to be a pixel in each frame. Increasing this number might lead to the recognition of more beads, but also to more false recognitions. You can estimate this number by estimating the number of beads in each frame and multiplying it by 2-3.</li>
                <li><b>w<sub>x</sub>(z)/w<sub>x</sub>(z)-fit z-range fraction:</b>: fraction of the points on the z-axis, which are used for the w<sub>x</sub>(z)/w<sub>x</sub>(z)-fits.</li>
                <li><b>est. PSF width (1/e halfwidth):</b>: estimates 1/e2-width of the PSF in nanometers (e.g. $(\lambda/\mbox{NA})$)</li>
                <li><b>est. PSF height (1/e halfwidth):</b>: estimates 1/e2-height of the PSF in nanometers (e.g. $(2\cdot\lambda/\mbox{NA}^2)$)</li>
                <li><b>use median filter</b>: If this is activated, each frame will be offset-corrected with a median filter, before searching for beads. This allows to find beads, even if there is a global intensity gradient present in the images.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Click on <b>Fit Current</b> to run the evaluation (described above). After the evaluation has finished, you can look at the different results in the tabs on the left.</li>
            <li>In the <b>filter beads for display</b> group, you can filter out beads based on several properties. $$note:This is done fo display only!$$. A typical filter is to limit the range of the axial ratio to 1..3, if you expect an axial ration of 2 for your microscope. This way you can get rid of beads, where two beads were present in the image and the 3D-fit tried to cover both by the Gaussian (which often results in enlarged Gaussian functions/axial rations). With the checkbox in the group-header, you can switch this feature on and off.</li>
            <li><b>Save Current ROI</b> will save the current ROI as an image stack (e.g. in TIFF format)</li>
            <li><b>Save All ROIs</b> will save all ROIs in the current file as image stacks (e.g. in TIFF format). This function will add the channel and bead number to the filename.</li>
            <li><b>Save Averaged ROI</b> will take all currently filtered (see above) ROIs and average them into a single ROI (per channel). In this process, the output ROI is supersamples with a user-defineable factor. Each single ROI is shifted to the center of the output image, using the super-resolution center estimated from the 3D gaussian fit. The pixels in the output image are read from the ROI, suing linear interpolation.</li>
