<h2>Viewing imFCS data</h2>
<p>The imFCS (or imFCCS) data is represented as imagingFCS raw data records (RDRs) in a QuickFit project. If FCCS data was acquired, each type of correlation function (e.g. ACF1, ACF2 and FCCS for two-color cross-correlation data) is represented as its own RDR. the role of the RDRs encodes the type of correlation curve. 
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic000"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic000.png" border="1">
</center></p>

<p>By double-clicking on any such RDR, the <a href="imfcs_ui.html">imagingFCS RDR editor</a> opens up.

<a name="#import"><h2>Importing Imaging FCS Data</h2>
<p>In order to import imaging FCS data into QuickFit $$version$$ click on <b>Data Items | Insert Raw Data | load imFCS Dataset</b> in QuickFit's <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$qf3_mainscreen.html">mainwindow</a>. Then you should select an appropriate file to import (see section <a href="imfcs_dataformats.html#formats">Data Formats</a> for details on the importable files). Usually a <tt><i>BASENAME</i>.evalsettings.txt</tt> should exist, if you selected to import a file <tt><i>BASENAME</i>.autocorrelation.dat</tt>. If so the plugin will use it to extract some metadata about the imported correlation data (width/height of the imaging FCS region, settings of the correlator, ...). If this files is not present you will have to provide some data by hand (width/height of the imaging FCS data). If you imported cross-correlation data this function will create one raw data record for every cross correlation function in the file, as one imaging FCS raw data record may only represent one curve per pixel.

<p>This plugin also provides a <a href="#correlating">software correlator</a> that can read image series and then  calculate the autocorrelation from these and a <a href="#simulation">Simulation Tool</a>.</p>

<h3>Starting the correlator</h3>
<p>This plugin supplied a simple dialog that allows to set all options, for the evaluation described above. It allows to define several "jobs" and to evaluate these one-by one (also some in parallel on a multi-core machine), as usually the correlation may take several minutes (which allows you to go and drink a short coffee ;-) Note however that correlation usually creates a high load on hard disk access, so you do not always improve the processing speed with more cores, as the bottle-neck is the harddisk access speed.</p>
<p>You start the correlator by clicking on <b>Data Items | Insert Raw Data | correlate images and insert</b>.<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic002"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic002.png" border="1">
</center> Then a dialog will pop up, as shown below:
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic003"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic003.png" border="1">
</center>
</p> 
</p>

<h3>Opening an image file</h3>
<p>First you will have to select a file containing the image series (<b>Image Series</b>):<ul>
  <li><img src=":/imaging_fcs/fileopen.png"> displays a dialog that allows to selecta file from the hard disk.</li>
  <li><img src=":/imaging_fcs/use_file.png"> will load an image series entered in the input field by hand.</li>
  <li>The <b>"don't count"</b> alternatives are faster options. The assume that the newly selected image file has the same number of frames and other properties, as the current one. Therefore the software does not have to count the frames in the input file, which can be significantly faster, especially for TIFF files.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Subsequently the plugin will read the image series properties and meta-data. Then you can set all the properties (details, <a href="#corroptions">see below</a>) defining the actions to be taken.</p>
<p>If you activate the <b>Preview</b> button, a new window will open, which shows the first frame of the image series, that you selected.</p>
<p>$$note:If your image data is stored as a TIFF file, it is advised to use the <b>tinyTIFF</b> image reader, since it is faster than libTIFF and can read more frames. If your file is not readablke with tinyTIFF, you will have to revert to libTIFF!$$</p>



    
<a name="corroptions"><h3>Correlator Options</h3>
$$see:The help page on <a href="imfcs_correlator.html">theoretic description of the implemented correlation algorithms</a> for additional details. This page describes the user-interface!$$

<h4>Output filename</h4>
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic010"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic010.png" border="1">
</center>
<p>All the output files start with the same <tt>basename</tt> in the filenames (see above). This <tt>basename</tt> is created from three parts (let's assume that the input filename is <tt><i>[path_to]/[inputfilename].[ext]</i></tt>):
    <blockquote><tt><i>[path_to]/</i><b>[prefix]</b><i>[inputfilename]</i><b>[postfix]</b><i>[ending]</i></tt></blockquote>
    Here <tt><i>[inputfilename]</i></tt> is the filename without extension of the input file (i.e. <tt>inputfilename</tt>), <tt></i>[ending]</i></tt> is the ending specifying the output file (see above, e.g. <tt>.evalsetting.txt</tt>, <tt>.autocorrelation.dat</tt>, ...). If <tt><i>[prefix]</i></tt> contains directory separators (<tt>/</tt>) the output files will be created in subdirectories. in addition you may use some special strings in <tt><i>[prefix]</i></tt> and <tt><i>[postfix]</i></tt> (case-insensitive):
    <ul>
      <li><tt>%COUNTER%</tt> will first simply be deleted. If a set of output files with the given name already exist, the counter is increased until no output files with the given name exist.</li>
      <li><tt>%S%</tt> S parameter of the correlator</li>
      <li><tt>%P%</tt> P parameter of the correlator</li>
      <li><tt>%M%</tt> m parameter of the correlator</li>
      <li><tt>%framerate%</tt> framerate in Herz</li>
      <li><tt>%frametime%</tt> frametime in microseconds</li>
      <li><tt>%first%</tt> first used frame</li>
      <li><tt>%last%</tt> last used frame</li>
      <li><tt>%backoffset%</tt> offset of background correction</li>
      <li><tt>%backcorrection%</tt> background correction mode</li>
      <li><tt>%backcorrectionid%</tt> background correction mode as number</li>
      <li><tt>%segments%</tt> segments the image series is cut into</li>
      <li><tt>%correlator%</tt> correlator type used</li>
      <li><tt>%correlatorid%</tt> correlator type used as number</li>
    </ul>
    As an example if <tt><i>[prefix]</i>="./results/"</tt> and <tt><i>[postfix]</i>="%COUNTER%"</tt>, the these output files will be created:
    <blockquote><tt>[path_to]/results/[inputfilename].autocorrelation.dat<br>[path_to]/results/[inputfilename].crosscorrelation.dat<br>...
    </tt></blockquote>
    If you start a job for the same input file and the same postfox/prefix again, these files will be created:
    <blockquote><tt>[path_to]/results/[inputfilename]<b>1</b>.autocorrelation.dat<br>[path_to]/results/[inputfilename]<b>1</b>.crosscorrelation.dat<br>...
    </tt></blockquote>
</p>
$$note:Good values for these parameters are:
<ul>
    <li><b>prefix = </b> <tt>./results/</tt></li>
    <li><b>postfix = </b> <tt>_corr%correlator%_back%backcorrection%_bleach%bleach%_bin%binning%_%COUNTER%</tt></li>
</ul>$$



<h4>Microscope/Camera properties</h4>
<p>If your microscope does not save metadata (e.g.<b> pixel size</b>s) together with the raw data or they are not readable by QuickFit, then you can supply some of these data next to the checkbox "<b>camera description</b>", if it is activated. This can also be used to overwrite values possibly set in the experiment description. The setable values are:<ol>
    <li>pixel width/height in nanometers: These are the width/height of the pixels in the image plane, i.e. taking into account the magnification.</li>
  </ol></p>
<p>It is especially important to set the correct <b>framerate</b> (in images/second) or <b>frame time</b> (=1/framerate in microseconds), as this is crucial for the correctlag time axis.</li> 
</p>



<h4>Cropping of the Image Series in Space &amp; Time</h4>
<p>Sometimes one wants to exclude certain parts of the image series. This is possible by setting the <b>first</b> and <b>last frame</b> under <b>frame range</b>. If the check-boxes for each of the range ends are checked, the correlation starts at the first frame in the file/ends with the last frame in the file. If you deactivate the check-boxes, you can set the range freely (within the number of frames in the file).</p>
<p>With the <b>cropping</b>-widgets, you can crop the input image to a given x- and y-range. The button "select cropping" allows to select one of several predefined seetings:
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic004"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic004.png" border="1">
</center>
When using predefined cropping, you will be asked for the size <i>N</i> of the region (in pixels). The available options for predefined cropping are:
<ol>
    <li><b>crop center</b> crops only the central <i>N*N</i> pixels</li>
    <li><b>crop left center</b> crops <i>N*N</i> pixels in the center of the left half image (useful for DualView images, to select the central pixels in the left color channel)</li>
    <li><b>crop right center</b> crops <i>N*N</i> pixels in the center of the right half image (useful for DualView images, to select the central pixels in the right color channel)</li>
    <li><b>crop top center</b> crops <i>N*N</i> pixels in the center of the top half image (useful for DualView images, to select the central pixels in the top color channel)</li>
    <li><b>crop bottom center</b> crops <i>N*N</i> pixels in the center of the bottom half image (useful for DualView images, to select the central pixels in the bottom color channel)</li>
</ol>
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic005"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic005.png" border="1">
</center>
</p>

<h4>Pixel Binning</h4>
$$see:<a href="imfcs_binning.html#binning">This help-page</a> for theoretic/mathematical details on the implemented binning.$$
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic007"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic007.png" border="1">
</center>
<p>With these controls you can set the binning of the pixels in the input image series:
<ul>
    <li>The value <i>B</i> given in the spin-box "<b>binning</b>" tell QuickFit to form super-pixels, consisting of <i>B*B</i> input pixels, before correlation.</li>
    <li>Typically the values for the super-pixel are summed up. If you want to average the values, you can activate the check-box "<b>average</b>".</li>
    <li>Usually every input pixel only contributes to one super-pixel, i.e. the super-pisels are shifted by <i>B</i> pixels. The check-box <b>interleaved</b> allows to use a scheme, where the super-pixels are shifted by one pixel only:
<center><img src="binning.png"></center> </li>
</ul>
</p>



<h4>Background Correction</h4>
$$see:<a href="imfcs_background.html">This help-page</a> for theoretic/mathematical details on the implemented background-correction$$
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic008"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic008.png" border="1">
</center>
<p>Here you can set the mode of background-correction. QuickFit can either:
<ol>
    <li>perform no correction</li>
    <li>subtract a fixed value</li>
    <li>remove the minimum pixel value over the whole input image series</li>
    <li>subtract the average over a given image series, which has to have the same size (width/height) and file format as the input image series.</li>
</ol>
</p>


    


<h4>Bleach Correction</h4>
$$see:<a href="imfcs_bleach.html">This help-page</a> for theoretic/mathematical details on the implemented bleach correction.$$
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic009"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic009.png" border="1">
</center>
<p>
  Here you can choose the mode of bleach-correction, that QuickFit will apply after subtracting the background signal and before calculating the correlation functions. In all cases QuickFit will first generate a coarse time-series for the intensity in every pixel, to which an appropriate model function is fit. Then this decaying model function is removed from the detailed input time-series of the pixel ("de-trending"). <a href="imfcs_bleach.html">The help-page on the details of the bleach correction</a> lists all possibilities, that can be selected in the combobox. The value in the spin-box "<b>frames to average for the bleach correction</b>" determines how many frames to average for the coarse time-series, used for the fit. $$note:This value is typically automatically determined by QuickFit to be <i>N/2500</i>, where <i>N</i> is the number of rames in the input image series, which is usually a good guess.$$
</p>



<h4>DualView-mode and 2-color-FCCS-Settings</h4>
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic010"><img src="./pic/dualview_fccs.png" border="1">
</center>
<p>The imFCS correlator is written to directly support imagingFCCS measurements, that were acquired on a DualView optics. The image series then contains two color channels (e.g. green and red) side-by-side in each frame. The correlator will split the image in two halves (the mode of splitting and the ordering of the color-channels can be selected in the combobox "<b>Dual-view mode</b>"). Then for each half-image, an autocorrelation function is calculated (ACF1: left/top &amp; ACF2: right/bottom). In addition the two-color cross-correlation function can be calculated (FCCS), if the check-box "<b>2-color FCCS is activated</b>".</p>
<p>The three correlation functions (ACF1+ACF2+FCCS) will be imported as three separate records into the project!</p>



<h4>Correlator Settings</h4>
$$see:The help page on <a href="imfcs_correlator.html">theoretic description of the implemented correlation algorithms</a> for additional details. This page describes the user-interface!$$
<br>
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic011"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic011.png" border="1">
</center>
<p>
These controls allow set the detailed properties of the used correlation algorithm and which correlation functions to calculate:
<ul>
    <li>if <b>ACF for each pixel</b> is checked, the autocorrelation of every pixel is calculated. $$bmath:g(\tau):=\frac{\langle I(t;x,y)\cdot I(t+\tau;x,y)\rangle}{\langle I(t;x,y)\rangle^2}-1$$</li>
    <li>if <b>CCF to distant pixel</b> is checked, a set of 2-pixel cross-correlation functions is calculated. The input field <b>&Delta;x1,&Deltay1;...</b> lists the pixel shifts (&Delta;x, &Delta;y) that should be calculated. For every shift (&Delta;x, &Delta;y) that is given in the list, one cross-correlation function $$bmath:g_{\times}(\tau; \Delta x,\Delta y):=\frac{\langle I(t;x,y)\cdot I(t+\tau;x+\Delta x,y+\Delta y)\rangle}{\langle I(t;x,y)\rangle\cdot\langle I(t; x+\Delta x,y+\Delta y)\rangle}-1$$ is calculated. The list of shifts (&Delta;x, &Delta;y) is given in the form
<blockquote>
    <tt>&Delta;x<sub>1</sub>, &Delta;y<sub>1</sub> ; &Delta;x<sub>2</sub>, &Delta;y<sub>2</sub> ; &Delta;x<sub>3</sub>, &Delta;y<sub>3</sub> </tt>
</blockquote>
So if you want to calculate the distance cross-correlation functions to all four neighboring pixels, you will have to give the shifts:
$$codeexample:1,0 ; -1,0 ; 0,1 ; 0,-1$$
You can right-click the input field to open its context-menu, which contains entries, that generate pre-defined lists of shifts, e.g. for the 4 direct neighbors. The downward arrow at the rhs of the input field allows to select previously used shift-settings.
    <li>The spin-box <b>"segments"</b> allows you to split the input image series into <i>N</i> segments. For each of these (equally long) segments, a separate correlation function is calculated and finally the average and standard deviation over these correlation functions is loaded into the project. This allows to use the standard deviation as an estimate of the measurement error of the correlation function, which can improve fit results. Also it is possible to later remove some of these segments form the average, e.g. to exclude any discontinuities from the measurement (e.g. aggregates moving through a pixel/the image).<br>Typically the segments should not be too short (at least 10,000-20,000 frames), so the calculated correlation function has sufficient statistical significance. Usually a value of 3-6 is a good choice, if ~100,000 frames were acquired.</li>
    <li>The input widgets <b>correlator</b> allow to modify the type of correlator, that is used for the data processing. the details of the available choices are explained in the help-page <a href="imfcs_correlator.html">theoretic description of the implemented correlation algorithms</a>.<br>A good choice is usually: $$example:<b>correlator</b> = <tt>Direct Correlation with Averaging</tt>, <br><b>P</b> = <tt>8 or 16</tt>, <br><b>m</b> = <tt>2</tt>, <br><b>S</b> selected, so &tau;<sub>max</sub> is a little bit larger than the segment length.$$</li>
</li>
</ul>
</p>


    
<h4>Number &amp; Brightness</h4>    
<p>If this check-box is activated, also a <a href="$$plugin_info:help:number_and_brightness$$">number &amp; brightness RDR</a> from the measurement is loaded into the project.</p>



<h4>Statistics &amp; Video</h4>    
<p>
The controls in this section allow to set options for additional statistics dtaa, that the correlator calculates:
<ul>
    <li>The correlator calculates <b>statistics</b> from the input image-series, by averaging (+ standard deviation, minima, maxima, ...) the given number of input frames (and all pixels therein). these datasets are stored as CSV-files and can be used to see, whether global intensity changes or discontinuities occured in the image series. Several statistics files are generated, for the un-corrected, the corrected input data and also for the background data.</li>
    <li>A <b>video</b> is calculated, by averaging the given number of input frames into video-frames. Usually the number of frames is set, so approximately 1000 video-frames are produced. Actually two videos will be stored to disk (as TIFF files), one before and one after bleach correction. These videos allow to inspect, what has happened during the measurement. In addition they can be used to extract e.g. image flow maps from the measurement.</li>
</ul>
All datset, produced in this section will be loaded and displayed in the tab <a href="imfcs_ui.html#images_videos">"Images, Videos, Staistics"</a> of the imFCS raw data record editor.
</p>

    
    
       
<h3>Starting the Correlation</h3>    
$$note:If you want to immediately add the results to the current project, don't forget to check the corresponding box below the parameters.$$
<p>Finally a click on <b><img src=":/imaging_fcs/add_job.png"> add job</b> will add the job to the list of jobs to be processed (bottom of the window). </p>
<p>All the processing jobs (threads) are shown as a list in the bottom of the correlator dialog. The status of each job is displayed together with its progress and the overall progress. The current status of each job is shown as an icon:
<blockquote>
    <img src=":/imaging_fcs/thread_wait.png"> <b>waiting:</b> The job waits for an empty processing slot.<br>
    <img src=":/imaging_fcs/thread_run.png"> <b>running:</b> The job is currently processed.<br>
