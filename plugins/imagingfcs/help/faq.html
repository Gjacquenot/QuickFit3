  <a name="FAQ_IMFCS"><b>What is an imaging fluorescence correlatioon spectroscopy (imFCS)?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  In standard FCS, measurements are performed for single positions in a sample. In imFCS, an array detector (fast camera) is used to record the fluorescence fluctuations from several pixels in the sample simultaneously. The for each pixel in the measurement, an autocorrelation (and possibly pixel-pixel or two-color-cross-correlation) curves are calculated and evaluated. Finally the fit parameters (e.g. the diffusion coefficient) can be represented as a map or image for the sample, reporting on how fast particles move at different positions in the sample. imFCS is usually impelemnted on a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRF) or a single plane illumination microscope (SPIM).

       <a name="FAQ_IMAGESTACK_DATAFORMATS"><b>Which image stack data formats are supported by QuickFit?</b>
     $$faq_answer$$
       QuickFit supports all image stack data formats, for which a reader plugin is installed. The most common formats are: <b>uncompressed multi-frame TIFFs</b>, as they can be exported from most microscope control software packages.<br>Your QuickFit installation has these image imprter plugins installed:$$list:imageseriesimporters:$$

  <a name="FAQ_SIMULATE"><b>Can I simulate an imFCS/imFCCS experiment?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Yes, a simple simulator is implemented in QuickFit. It creates an image stack from the random walk of several fluorescenctly labeled particles in a plane. See <a href="simulation.html">imFCS Simulation</a> for details.

  <a name="FAQ_FCCSDATA"><b>How are imFCCS data represented in QuickFit?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  In imFCCS experiments, several auto- and cross-correlation curves exist for every pixel in the measurement (e.g. two auto- [ACF0,ACF1] and one two-color cross-correlation [CCF/DCCF/FCCS] curves). QuickFit generates one raw data record (RDR) for each of these curves (all in the same RDR group) and an imFCCS global fit may recognize these several records and fit them all together. If you open the FCCS record (i.e. the RDR editor by double-clicking it in the project tree), you can choose the <b>FCCS display</b> mode:

This mode is suitable for 2-color FCCS data, since it will display the autocorrelation curves ACF0 (green), ACF1 (red) and the cross-correlation curve FCCS (blue) for each pixel in the correlation fucntion plot on the lhs. In addition you can provide a cross-talk and QuickFit will display crosstalk-corrected correlation amplitudes as lines in the plots and as number in the parameter panel on the rhs of the dialog (see screenshot above!).

</center>
<br>For 2-pixel cross-correlation data (also often called distance cross-correlation data), you can choose the <b>DCCF mode</b>, which is more general than the FCCS mode. It displays for each pixel all correlation curves in the currenzt group, but it lacks the possibility to calculate cross-talk corrected CF amplitudes, since this does not make sense in all settings.

       <a name="FAQ_BACKGROUND"><b>The concentrazion/particle number image from my fit does not reproduce the intensity image. Why?</b>
     $$faq_answer$$
       This might be due to a bad background signal correction, as explained <a href="nah_background_correction.html">here</a> and in <a href="tutorial_cell.html">this tutorial</a>.

       <a name="FAQ_UI_COPYTOALLRDR"><b>How can I reuse the display settings in the imagingFCS "parameter image" tab of the RDR editor for all RDRs?</b>
     $$faq_answer$$
       <p>In many settings widgets in this tab, a right-click will open a context-menu, in which you can copy the settings in the clicked widget to all othe rrecords. So e.g. if you copy the "overview image settings" to all records, the same display settings (color bar, ranges, ...) will be used if you select a different record in this window!</p>
       <p>In the histogram and correlation plot tabs, a button serves the same purpose.</p>
       $$note:Some settings are specific to the chosen parameter (e.g. the parameter image ranges/colorbars/... or the histograms), so if you select another RDR, the settings will only be used for the same fit paramter!$$

       <a name="FAQ_COLOCALIZATION"><b>Can I also perform a colocalization-analysis for my imagingFCCS data?</b>
     $$faq_answer$$
       <p>Yes, this is possible using the plugin <a href="$$plugin_info:help:eval_colocalization$$">Colocalization Analysis</a>. The imFCS RDRs expose an image stack for the overview image with both color channels. This can be used for the colocalization analysis:<ol>
  <li>add a <a href="$$plugin_info:help:eval_colocalization$$">Colocalization Analysis</a> evaluation to your project (in the main screen: <b>Data Items | Insert Evaluation | Colocalization Analysis</b>)</li>
  <li>Start the plugin by double-clicking it in the project tree</li>
  <li>Choose a record on the RHS and the choose the <b>stack: "time-averaged image"</b></li>
  <li>On the lhs of the dialog, you'll now see the colocalization analysis for this record.</li>
