    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>It is often interesting to estimate the amount of bleaching of the fluorescnece during a measurement. This tutorial explains how to do that. Typically we propose to set the laser power to a setting with which the bleaching is limited to less than 50-60% during the acquisition (typically ~60s).</p>

               
     
     <h2>Tutorial</h2>
     <p>
     <ol>
         <li>Correlate your dataset as usual for your imFCS evaluation, using your typical bleach correction (often exp(poly4) for cell data).</li>
         <li>Open the imFCS RDR editor by double-clicking the according record in the project tree and choose the tab <b>Countrate/Intensity Trace</b>. Therein select the <b>"uncorrected time-binned video"</b> at the top-right of the window:

</center>
</li>
         <li>In this plot you can view the bleaching on any pixel, that you can select in the overview image at the bottom-right. The plot shows the intensity timetrace (green solid curve), the bleach-correction fit (dark-green, dashed, if applicable) and the background-level (dotted horizontal line) extracted from the background image series. From this curve you can extract three numbers (values given for the example above):<ul>
    <li>background level: $(B=370.5)$</li>
    <li>initial intensity: $(I_0=2303)$</li>
    <li>final intensity: $(I_1=1490)$</li>
</ul>From these you can calculate the percentage of bleaching: $[ p_{bleach}=\frac{I_1-I_0}{I_1-B}\approx42\%.  ]$</li>
         <li>The correlator in this plugin performs this calculation for every pixel. To view this information, select the tab <b>Images, Videos, Timetraces</b>. and therein choose the <b>image/video</b> = <b>bleach percentage file</b>:

</center>As you can see, the color-scale shows a large range. By choosing the histogram-tab, you can view the distribution of bleaching a bit better. YOu can also set the range to <b>auto</b> and choose the limits 0..100:
<center><a name="tutorial_bleachpercentage_pic002"><img src="./pic/tutorial_bleachpercentage_pic002.png" border="1">
</center>
So the bleaching was ~44% on average (median of the distribution).
</li>
         <li>To combine this image with a mask for the image, go back to the <b>Image/Video</b> tab and click the button <b>Image as RDR Result</b> above the image. This saves the image of bleach percentage as a fit result, which can be selected in the tab <b>Parameter Image</b>:

</center>
Here you can also define a mask for the measurement (e.g. by the menu <b>Mask | mask by overview</b>), which allows to measure bleaching percentage only for those pixels, which actually contain fluorescnece:
