    <h2>Introduction</h2>    
    <p>The simulation function allows to create an image stack that can subsequently be correlated using the 
    <a href="imfcs_correlation.html">imFCS correlator</a>. The image stack is e.g. created from a configurable random walk and 
    stored as TIFF sequence to harddisk. All necessary meta-information (frametime, pixel-size, ...) is stored together with the TIFF file in a configuration 
    file format that the imFCS correlator understands.</p>
   
<h2>Starting the sSmulator</h2>
<p>You can start the simulator from Quickfit's main window, by clicking  <b>Data Items | Insert Raw Data | simulate images for correlation</b>
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic002"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic002.png" border="1">
</center>
The simulation dialog looks like this:
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic006"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic006.png" border="1">
</center>
</p>
<p>After entering all simulation properties (see below), you have to click on <b>Run Simulation</b> to start the process. This will generate the TIFF-file, specified as <b>output filename</b>, along with some text-files, describing the simulation and image properties. When the simulation is finished, the simulation dialog will be closed and the TIFF-file will be loaded into the <a href="imfcs_ui.html">imFCS correlator</a> dialog.

<h2>Simulation Properties</h2>
<h3>2D Random Walk</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The simulation performs a 2D random walk with periodic boundary conditions for each walker</li>
    <li>There are up to three sets of walkers: green ones (always there), red ones and red+green ones (the last two only in the dual view mode). 
    Each set has its own diffusion coefficient  and a global flow may be added in addition. Every walker is thus displaced in every timestep $$math:\Delta t$$: 
      $$bmath:\Delta x=N(0,\sqrt{2\cdot D\cdot \Delta t})+v_x\cdot \Delta t$$ 
      $$bmath:\Delta y=N(0,\sqrt{2\cdot D\cdot \Delta t})+v_y\cdot \Delta t$$ 
    where $$math:N(0,\sigma)$$ is a normally distributed random number with mean 0 and variance $$math:\sigma^2$$.</li>
    <li>Then the intensity in each pixel is calculated as
    $$bmath:I_g(x,y)=N(B, \sigma_B)+\sum_{i=1}^{N_g} b_g\cdot\exp\left(-2\cdot\frac{(x-x_{g,i})^2+(y-y_{g,i})^2}{w_{xy}^2}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{N_{rg}} b_g\cdot\exp\left(-2\cdot\frac{(x-x_{rg,i})^2+(y-y_{rg,i})^2}{w_{xy}^2}\right)$$
    $$bmath:I_r(x,y)=N(B, \sigma_B)+\sum_{i=1}^{N_r} b_r\cdot\exp\left(-2\cdot\frac{(x-x_{r,i})^2+(y-y_{r,i})^2}{w_{xy}^2}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{N_{rg}} b_r\cdot\exp\left(-2\cdot\frac{(x-x_{rg,i})^2+(y-y_{rg,i})^2}{w_{xy}^2}\right)$$
    Here $$math:w_{xy}$$ is the parameter <code>psf_size</code>, $$math:N_g, N_r, N_{rg}$$ are the numbers of green, red and red+green walkers and $$math:b_g, b_r$$ are the molecular brightnesses of the red and green dyes. 
    The pairs $$math:(x_{g,i}, y_{g,i}), (x_{r,i}, y_{r,i}), (x_{rg,i}, y_{rg,i})$$ are the trajectories (time index $$math:i$$) of the green, red and red+green walkers. The background signal
    is calculated from a normal distribution with mean $$math:B$$ and standard deviation $$math:\sigma_B$$.
    </li>
    <li>In dual view mode, the output image has twice the given width and the right part of it represents the red detection channel. This is thus a simple
    simulation of a DualView optical system, as often used for imFCS. </li>
</ul>  </body>
