    <h2>Introduction</h2>    
    <p>The simulation function allows to create an image stack that can subsequently be correlated using the 
    <a href="imfcs_correlation.html">imFCS correlator</a>. The image stack is e.g. created from a configurable random walk and 
    stored as TIFF sequence to harddisk. All necessary meta-information (frametime, pixel-size, ...) is stored together with the TIFF file in a configuration 
    file format that the imFCS correlator understands.</p>
   
<h2>Starting the sSmulator</h2>
<p>You can start the simulator from Quickfit's main window, by clicking  <b>Data Items | Insert Raw Data | simulate images for correlation</b>
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic002"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic002.png" border="1">
</center>
The simulation dialog looks like this:
<center><a name="imfcs_usage_pic006"><img src="./pic/imfcs_usage_pic006.png" border="1">
</center>
</p>
<p>After entering all simulation properties (see below), you have to click on <b>Run Simulation</b> to start the process. This will generate the TIFF-file, specified as <b>output filename</b>, along with some text-files, describing the simulation and image properties. When specifying the filename, you can use some special strings that will be replaced by certain simulation parameters:give a filename for the main output file (with extension <tt>.tif</tt> or <tt>.tiff</tt>) on the hard-disk.<br>
<ul>
  <li><tt>%counter%</tt>: is increased, until a non-existent filename is found (prevents overwriting of old filenames)</li>
  <li><tt>%type%</tt>: simulation type</li>
  <li><tt>%timestep%</tt>: simulation timestep in &mu;s</li>
  <li><tt>%shift%</tt>: shift between g/r foci</li>
  <li><tt>%dvmode%</tt>: DualView mode</li>
  <li><tt>%D1g%</tt>: D1, green</li>
  <li><tt>%D1r%</tt>: D1, red</li>
  <li><tt>%D1gr%</tt>: D1, green-red</li>
  <li><tt>%D2g%</tt>: D2, green</li>
  <li><tt>%D2r%</tt>: D2, red</li>
  <li><tt>%D2gr%</tt>: D2, green-red</li>
  <li><tt>%flow%</tt>: flow velocity</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>When the simulation is finished, the simulation dialog will be closed and the TIFF-file will be loaded into the <a href="imfcs_ui.html">imFCS correlator</a> dialog.
</p>



<h2>Simulation Properties</h2>
<h3>2D Random Walk</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The simulation performs a 2D random walk with (usually) periodic boundary conditions for each walker. If "random re-introduce" boundary conditions are choose, any walker that leaves the simulational box is re-introduced randomly on the border of the box.</li>
	<li>The simulation generates creates $(N_\text{frames})$ frames with a frametime of $(\Delta t_\text{frame})$ each. It actually progresses in simulation timesteps $(\Delta t)$ (note that $(\Delta t_\text{frame})$ has to be an integer multiple of $(\Delta t)$), which may be shorter than $(\Delta t_\text{frame})$. The intensity (see below) created in each simulation timestep is accumulated, until the next frame is ready.</li>
    <li>There are up to seven different sets of walkers: 3&times; green walkers (always there), 2&times; red walkers and 2&times; red+green walkers (the last two are only available in the dual view mode). 
    Each set has its own diffusion coefficient  and a global flow may be added in addition. Every walker is thus displaced in every timestep $$math:\Delta t$$: 
      $$bmath:\Delta x=N(0,\sqrt{2\cdot D\cdot \Delta t})+v_x\cdot \Delta t$$ 
      $$bmath:\Delta y=N(0,\sqrt{2\cdot D\cdot \Delta t})+v_y\cdot \Delta t$$ 
    where $$math:N(0,\sigma)$$ is a normally distributed random number with mean 0 and variance $$math:\sigma^2$$. $$note:The flow may be limited to the right image half (y>width/2).<br>Also the diffusion of each species may be limited to the bottom half (x>width/2) of the image. Then in the x-direction the boundary conditions are no longer periodic, but reflective (in y-direction they stay periodic!). Be aware, that therefore limiting the diffusion space and using flow may lead to a concentration of the particles at a border!$$ The simulation supports several possibilities for a structured environment:<ul>
	<li><b>free diffusion:</b> The particles progress freely, as described above.</li>
	<li><b>barrier mesh/regular barrier grid:</b> Here, a regular grid of barriers (spacing $(\Delta x_\text{grid})$ in x- and y-direction) is overlayn over the simulation space. If a particle tries to jump over any such barrier, this is only possible with a certain probability $(p_\text{barrier}/N_\text{jumps})$, where $(N_\text{jumps}\geq1)$ is the number of barriers, the particle tries to cross. </li>
	</ul></li>
    <li>Then the intensity in each pixel is calculated as
    $$bmath:I_g(x,y)=N(B, \sigma_B)+\Delta t\cdot\left[\sum_{p\in\{\text{g,g2,g3,rg,rg2}\}}\left(b_{g,p}\cdot I_{p}(x,y; w_{g}; \vec{\delta}_{gr})\right]$$
    $$bmath:I_r(x,y)=N(B, \sigma_B)+\Delta t\cdot\left[\sum_{p\in\{\text{r,r2,r3,rg,rg2}\}}\left(b_{r,p}\cdot I_{p}(x,y; w_{r}; \vec{\delta}_{gr})+\kappa_{gr}\sum_{p\in\{\text{g,g2,g3,rg,rg2}\}}\left(b_{g,p}\cdot I_{p}(x,y; w_{g}; \vec{\delta}_{gr})\right]$$
	$$bmath:\text{with intensity from component $p$:}\ \ \ \ \ I_{p}(x,y; w_{xy}; \vec{\delta})=\sum_{i=1}^{N_p} \cdot\exp\left(-2\cdot\frac{(x-x_{p,i}-\delta_x)^2+(y-y_{p,i}-\delta_y)^2}{w_{xy}^2}\right)
    Here $$math:w_{g/r}$$ are the parameters <code>psf_size</code> for the green and red PSF, $$math:N_g, N_r, N_{rg}, ...$$ are the numbers of green, red and red+green walkers and $$math:b_g, b_r, ...$$ are the molecular brightnesses (per second) of the red and green dyes. The crosstalk from the green into the red channel is given by the factor $(\kappa_{gr})$.
    The pairs $$math:(x_{g,i}, y_{g,i}), (x_{r,i}, y_{r,i}), (x_{rg,i}, y_{rg,i}), ...$$ are the trajectories (time index $$math:i$$) of the green, red and red+green walkers. The background signal
    is calculated from a normal distribution with mean $$math:B$$ and standard deviation $$math:\sigma_B$$.
    </li>
	<li>Finally the pixel-intensity is rounded to integer values.</li>
    <li>In dual view mode, the output image has twice the given width and the right part of it represents the red detection channel. This is thus a simple
    simulation of a DualView optical system, as often used for imFCS. </li>
