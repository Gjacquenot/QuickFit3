    <p>This dialog allows to create masks and pixel selections from a parameter image/overview image. On the left, you see the basic image in greyscales and the new mask in red (overlay). Above the plot, you can select a relaxed color-scaling mode, where you can select the quantile (of the pixel intensity distribution), which are excluded for the color-scaling. If this option is deactivated, the color-scaling spans the fullr ange of intensity values.</p>
	<p>On the rhs, you can set different modes for the masking:<ul>
	  <li><b>Threshold(s):</b> depending on the <b>mode</b>, you can set one or both thresholds</li>
	  <li><b>Mode</b>: You can mask in-range/out-of-ragnge pixels (2 thresholds), or pixels, that are larger/smaller than the (first) threshold</li>
	  <li><b>Mask Mode</b> determines, how the existing and the new mask are combined.</li>
	</ul></p>
