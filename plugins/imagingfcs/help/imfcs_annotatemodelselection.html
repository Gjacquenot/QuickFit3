	<p>This dialog allows to perform a model selection, e.g. based on chi<sup>2</sup> or the Akaike information criterion (AIC). You can reach it via the menu entry <b>"Imaging FCS Tools | Annotate Model COparison"</b> within them imaging FCS RDR-editor. This tool takes the fit results of several (user-selectable) <u>different fits</u> for the <u>same RDR</u>. From each evaluation result set, the tool reads the selected parameter, that should be used for the model comparison (e.g. the chi<sup>2</sup> or the Akaike information criterion). Then it creates a fit result, which contains a single array, which contains a number for every pixel, that indicates, which model should be used according to the selected criterion. You can also select, how a criterion wins (largest or smallest value in the combobox "mode"). Finally you can select to apply this analysis to several RDRs. Then a second dialog will open, that asks you to select the files to analyze. $$note:If several RDRs are evaluated, the same parameter/selected results are evaluated in each of these records.$$</p>
	<p>Thze results are displayed as annotations in the imagingFCS editor.</p>
