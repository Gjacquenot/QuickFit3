	 This plugin uses a subset of the available QuickFit Fit models. When implementing a model for the FCS Fit plugin, please keep these hints in mind:
	 <ul>
	   <li>Any fit model used by FCS Fit plugin must have an ID starting with <tt>fcs_</tt>, <tt>fccs_</tt> or <tt>dls_</tt>.</li>
	   <li>Some parameter names have special meaning and QuickFit will possibly fill in a special value:
	     <ul>
		   <li><tt>count_rate</tt> is the countrate measured together with the FCS curve (if available) in Hz or counts per second</li>
		   <li><tt>count_rate1</tt> is the countrate measured together with the FCCS curve in channel 1 (if available) in Hz or counts per second</li>
		   <li><tt>count_rate2</tt> is the countrate measured together with the FCCS curve in channel 2 (if available) in Hz or counts per second</li>
		   <li><tt>pixel_width, pixel_height</tt> are the width and height of image pixels (usually also taking care of binning) in nanometers.</li>
		 </ul>
	   </li>
	 </ul>
