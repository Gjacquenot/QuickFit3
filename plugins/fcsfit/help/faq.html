  <a name="FAQ_WEIGHTING"><b>What do the fit weighting optins mean?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  See the help-page <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$/fcsfit_weighting.html">Fit Weighting</a> for detailed information on the weighting of fits. Basically these allow to use an error estimate for each measured point on the correlation curve, which determines how much the data point should influence the final result.

  <a name="FAQ_FOCALVOLUME"><b>How can I perform a focal volume estimation/calibration for a confocal microscope?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
This is a common task in confocal FCS and this plugin even offers a specialized tool for it. The basic workflow is as follows:
<ol>
    <li>Perform an FCS measurement on a sample with known diffusion coefficient. The <a href="$$plugin_info:help:calc_diffcoeff$$">Diffusion coefficient calculator Plugin</a> in QuickFit contains a database of  literature values for the diffusion coefficient of different dyes. Load the measured autocorrelation curve into QuickFit.</li>    
    <li>Now you have two possibilities:
    <ol>
        <li>Determine the diffusion coefficient $$math:D_{ref}$$ of your sample in your buffer and at the temperature of the measurement. Now you can select an FCS fit model, such as <b>FCS: Normal Diffusion 3D, D and gamma as parameter</b> (or any other model with diffusion coefficient D as a fit parameter). Provide all data you know about your microscope (basically the axial ratio $$math:\gamma$$) and set the diffusion coefficient to $$math:D_{ref}$$ and fix it. Make sure, that the focus size parameter $$math:w_{xy}$$, which you want to determine, is not fixed and perform a fit. As a result you get an estimate of the focus size $$math:w_{xy}$$, which you can then use (as a fixed parameter) for all further measurements of the day.</li>
        <li>You can use the standard FCS fit model <b>FCS: Normal Diffusion 3D</b>, which uses diffusion correlation times $$math:\tau_D$$ as parameters. Provide all data you know about your microscope (basically the axial ratio $$math:\gamma$$) and perform a fit. Finally you can use the "Focal Volume" tool (see button below fit parameters, or "Fit" menu) to estimate the focus size parameter $$math:w_{xy}$$ from the known diffusion coefficient $$math:D_{ref}$$ (see last item), or a known sample conecntration. The help page <a href="./estimate_focus.html">Estime focus parameter <i>w</i><sub>xy</sub> from fit results</a> contains a detailed description of this process.</li>

  <a name="FAQ_FILTER_RDRS"><b>How can I filter the list of raw data records, displayed in the plugin screen?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Above the list (rhs of the evaluation window), there are two fields, that allow to filter the displayed RDRs 
<center><a name="faq_pic000"><img src="./pic/faq_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
You can enter a simple filter expression there. then only those files will be displayed, which contain the given expression. As an example, if your project contains a full FCCS measurement with three RDRs per measurement (ACF0,ACF1 and FCCS), but you only want to fit ACF0-RDRs with this evaluation, simply enter ACF0 into the left field. the rhs filter-field allows to exclude all records, that do NOT contain the specified filter string. In addition you can use <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$qf3_qtregexp.html">regular expressions</a> for the filter strings.

  <a name="FAQ_MODELSELECTION"><b>How can I perform a statistical FCS model selection?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  The fit calculates several <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$fit_statistics.html">fit statistics parameters</a>, which allow to compare models and to find the model, which best fits you data, while obeying the principle of parsimony, which requires to use the simplest model, which is compatible with your data. The simplest parameter is the residual sum of squares (RSS or $(\chi^2)$), which tells you how well a model fits, but does not incorporate the number of model parameters, i.e. the model complexity. Parameters, that are connected to the RSS; but in addition penalize the model complexity are the Akaike information criterion (AICc) and the bayes information criterion (BIC), which are also available.$$note:A <a href="tutorial_modelselection.html">detailed tutorial</a> explains how to perform such a model selection analysis for an FCS measurement.$$
