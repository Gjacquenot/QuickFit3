This plugin implements FCS fit models (for a Gaussian focus), which are formulated for a distribution of diffusion times $$math:\tau_D$$ or diffusion coefficients $$math:D$$ etc. In general the models are of the form
$$bmath:g(\tau)=\frac{1}{N}\cdot X(\tau)\cdot\frac{\int_{\tau_{min}}^{\tau_{max}}p(\tau_D)\cdot\left(1+\frac{\tau}{\tau_D}\right)^{-1}\cdot\left(1+\frac{\tau}{\gamma^2\tau_D}\right)^{-1/2}\;\mathrm{d}\tau_D}{\int_{\tau_{min}}^{\tau_{max}}p(\tau_D)\;\mathrm{d}\tau_D}.$$
Here $$math:X(\tau)$$ summarizes a photophysical pre-factor, $$math:N$$ is the particle number and $$math:p(\tau_D)$$ an arbitrary, but normalizable distribution of the diffusion times $$math:\tau_D$$. the integration is limited to a (user-defineable) range $$math:\tau_{min}...\tau_{max}$$. The integrations are typically implemented, using the numerical integration methods, implemented in the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific library (GSL)</a>. In most models, the integration function <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/QAGS-adaptive-integration-with-singularities.html#QAGS-adaptive-integration-with-singularities"><tt>gsl_integration_qags()</tt></a> is used and the integration interval is split into two halves ($$math:\tau_{min}...\tau_{D}$$ and $$math:\tau_{D}...\tau_{max}$$). This allows the algorithms to accurately integrate over the peak of the distribution. Also a parameter transform $$math:\tau\rightarrow\tau'=\log(\tau)$$ is used to transform the integration domain from a logarithmic one into a linear one, which improves convergence of the numerical integration.

You should use a fast fit algorithm, such as <a href="$$fitalgorithm:help:fit_lmfit$$">$$fitalgorithm:name:fit_lmfit$$</a> for fitting the parameters of models of this type. It may also be advisable to fix the photophysics parameters (e.g. the triplet lifetime $$math:\tau_T$$ and triplett fraction $$math:\theta_T$$) to estimated values in a first fit run. Then the fit results can be refined in a second step, by unfixing these parameters.
