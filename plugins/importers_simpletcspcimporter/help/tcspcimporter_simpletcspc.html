		This plugins imports photons from simple TCSPC files, defined as follows:
		<ol>
		  <li>The binary files contain a header which is not parsed at the moment. The header ends with a sequence of 32 bytes with a values of <tt>0xFF</tt> each.</li>
		  <li>Each photon records contains the duration since the last photon and is 64 bits long:
		    <ol>
			    <li>bits 0..56 contain the time since the last photon in ticks (tick duration given as parameter and the user is asked for it on loading the file)</li>
				<li>bit 57 indicates photon in channel 2</li>
				<li>bit 58 indicates photon in channel 3</li>
				<li>bit 59 indicates photon in channel 1</li>
				<li>bit 60 indicates a special channel record for "RED OFF" (no photon)</li>
				<li>bit 61 indicates a special channel record for "RED ON" (no photon)</li>
				<li>bit 62 indicates a special channel record for "GREEN OFF" (no photon)</li>
				<li>bit 63 indicates a special channel record for "GREEN ON" (no photon)</li>
			</ol>
		  </li>
		</ol>
		$$note:THe 64-bit records are stored in the file in LITTLE ENDIAN form ... on a BIG ENDIAN system this will be corrected!$$
