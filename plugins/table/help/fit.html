    <h2>Starting this tool</h2>
    <p>Add a <a href="plots.html">plot</a> with the X- and Y-data, that you want to fit and specify the errors on the Y-data, if you want to use them to weight the least-squares fit. The you have to use the button <img src="./pic/plots_pic039.png"> in the advanced plot properties to display the fit dialog:
<center><a name="fit_pic000"><img src="./pic/fit_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
</p>


<h2>Performing a Fit</h2>
<p>
The plot on the left displays the data, the errors and the current fit. Below the main plot, the residuals are shown. At the top of the window, you can specify the fit algorithm and the fit model that shoulld be used. On the rhs, a table shows the fit parameters, the erros and their ranges. There you can also fix certain fit parameters.    
</p>
<p>
    Below the plot, you can change the plot options and change the range of data, used for the fit (excluded data points are shown as a red range in the graph!).
</p>
<p>
The button <b>Guess parameters</b> uses a feature, that is implemented in some fit models (it is activated only, if the feature is supported), which estimates inital values for the fit parameters, based on the given dataset.
</p>
<p>
The button <b>Fit</b>   performs the actual fit. Below that button, you can choose whether the fit should be weighted and whether bootstrapping should be used for the error estimates.  
</p>
<p>
When you are satisfied with the fit results, you can click on <b>Accept Fit</b>, which will add the fit as a graph to the current plot. The fit results can either be stored as parameters in the plot, or as a column in the table.
