<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This tutorial gives a walk-through of an imagingFCCS evaluation, where only the relative CCF-amplitudes are calculated (wihtout a fit). The example we chose is a measurement of different mixing rations of single- and double-labeled DNA fragments (607bp, Alexa-488-, Alexa-594- and Alexa-488+594-labeled).
    We will evaluate two measurements: one of a DL-only sample and one with a low fraction of DL (cAB:cA:cB=0.5:1:1). Note that the labeleing was not perfect, so also the DL-only sample contains single-labeled fragments of both colors!
</p>
<p>After correlating the measurements to yield the green- and red-channel autocorrelation functions (ACF0, ACF1) and the two color crosscorrelation function (FCCS).
The project now contains three imagingFCS raw data records for each sample:

<i>the demo project</i>
</center>
Note that all files belonging to one measurement are painted with the same background color shade. This indicates that all these files are inside
one "RDR group" withing the project. This group feature allows to connect all files that belong together, so an evaluation can make use of this fact. Here
the imFCCS fit will know which ACF1 and FCCS belong to a given ACF0. In addition to the group, each RDR has an "RDR role", which indicates what type of 
data is represented by the record (e.g. here: ACF0, ACF1 and FCCS). Both properties can be seen (and the group can be changed) in the "Properties" tab of the
raw data record:

</p>

<p>For the measurement these settings were used:
<ul>
    <li>330&mu;s frametime on an EMCCD with EMGain 300</li>    
    <li>491nm and 561nm lasers with 25W and 25mW overall power</li>
    <li>565nm beam splitter</li>
    <li>525/50 bandpass for green channel</li>
    <li>LP568 longpass filter for red channel</li>
    <li>Alexa-488 crosstalk into red channel: ~15%</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
</p>




<h2>Correlate Data</h2>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Download the example dataset, or acquire your own data.</li>
    <li>Start QuickFit and click on the menu entry <b>Data Items | Insert Raw Data | imagingFCS | correlate data and insert</b>.</li>
    <li>Click on <img src=":imaging_fcs/fileopen.png"> and select the acquisition data (e.g. <tt>DNA_DSinf_s01_laser1_491nm_25mW_laser2_561nm_25mW_000.tif</tt>) and make sure to select the <b>tinyTIFF reader</b>.</li>
    <li>Ensure, that all acquisition data is set correctly (pixel size, frametime, ...) and choose the appropriate <b>bleach correction</b> (e.g. <code>none</code> for beads, <code>exp</code>, <code>exp(poly2)</code> or <code>exp(poly4)</code> for in vitro samples, such as the DNA in the download, or <code>exp(poly4)</code> for cell data). Also make sure that an appropriate background measurement is selected.
    $$note:If you have very dim, or very fast samples, it sometimes helps to use 2x2 binning (for EMCCD cameras), or even higher binning for sCMOS cameras!$$</li>
    <li>Set the <b>DualView</b> mode to split horizontal, (or as appropriate for your measurement) and check <b>ACF</b> as well as <b>2-color FCCS</b>. The number of segments should be 3-5, Lags/Corr=16, lag-factor=2 and Correlators should be set, so &tau;<sub>max</sub> is a little larger than the length of each segment.
    <br>
    Here is a screenshot for the example dataset:

    </center>
    </li>
    <li>Now start the correlation by clicking <b>add job</b>.</li>
    <li>Repeat the setps above for every file, you want to correlate. $$note:If you correlate several files, set the number of <b>max. parallel jobs</b> to a value of 1-3, depending on the amount of CPU cores and memory, that is available on your machine.$$</li>
    <li>When all correlations are finished, close the dialog by clicking <b>Close</b>. Tzhe results will be inserted into the project now.</li>

<a name="relFCCS"><h2>Calculate relative FCCS amplitudes</h2>
<p>In this part of the tutorial we will calculate the relative CCF amplitude for each pixel, which is defined as:
$$bmath:\mbox{relFCCS}(x,y)=\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{N_{avg}}g_{FCCS}(x,y; \tau_i)}{\sum_{i=0}^{N_{avg}}g_{ACF}(x,y; \tau_i)}$$
where $$math:N$$ is a number of lag times $$math:\tau_i$$ to average over. the lag time $$math:\tau_0$$ is the minimal lagtime of the curve. The correlation curve 
$$math:g_{ACF/FCCS}(x,y;\tau)$$ describes the auto- (ACF) or crosscorrelation (FCCS) function at the pixel coordinate $$math:(x,y)$$ and the lagtime $$math:\tau$$.
Averaging over $$math:N_{avg}$$ channels/lags is performed to overcome the noise of the recorded correlation functions. By which ACF to divide (green or red) has to be 
selected according to the application. Usually one chooses the ACF with the lower amplitude (here typically the red ACF1, see above).
$$note:This measure relFCCS(x,y) can give an idea about the amount of corsscorrelation, but this is NOT crosstalk- or FRET-corrected.$$
</p>

<p>
To perform this evaluation, follow these steps:
<ol>
    <li>Go to QuickFit's main window and choose the menu entry "Tools|imFCCS|calculate relative CCF amplitudes". A new window will pop up:
    <center>    <a name="tutorial_pic010"><img src="./pic/tutorial_pic010.png" border="1"></center></li>
    <li>Select the ACF1 and FCCS for the first measurement in the top two comboboxes. Below these, the overview images of the two selected records are shown.</li>
    <li>Select $$math:N_{avg}=5$$ by entering 5 into the edit field "average channels".</li>
    <li>The lowest image plot shows the result image with a fixed color scale from 0 to 1. 
    $$note:Some pixels are above or below the sensible range of 0..1, which is mainly caused by the noisiness of the curves.$$
    </li>
    <li>click on "store this result" to store this image of rel. CCF amplitudes to the FCCS record. You can also click on "store all results" to store FCCS/ACF0 and 
    FCCS/ACF1 from every measurement in the project or "store all results, same role" to only store FCCS/ACF1, but from all records in the project.<br> Use "store all results"
    now and close the window when done.</li>
    <li>Open the FCCS RDR from the project for each measurement and choose the "Parameter Image" tab. </li>
    <li>Select the result set "rel. CCF amplitude of CCF/ACF: 'FCCS'/'ACF1'" and the parameter "results: relative CCF amplitude" therein.</li>
    <li>If you choose the "Histogram" tab, you can look at the distribution of relFCCS(x,y) values over the whole image:
