<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You can start an imFCCS evaluation, by adding an imFCCS evaluation item to your project (menu entry <tt>|Insert Evaluations|imFCCS Fit</tt> in the main window of QuickFit).</p>
<p><center><img src="./pic/ui_overview.png"></center>
The imFCCS plugin screen is separated into different parts:
<ul>
  <li>At the top of the window, you can select the <b>fit algorithm</b> and the <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$/fcsfit_weighting.html"><b>data weighting</b></a> to be used. You can also choose, how the plugin estimates the errors of the fit parameter with the <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$/fit_errorestimation.html"><strong>error estimation</strong></a> widgets. $$note:The context-menu of the fit algorithm combo-box allows you to change the fit algorithm parameters and open the onine-help page for the selected fit algorithm.$$</li>
  <li>In the center of the screen, an <b>overview image</b> of the measurement is displayed. Here you can also select (by clicking) the current pixel/run can be selected.</li>
  <li>The <b>correlation curves</b> of the selected pixel are displayed on the left of the overview image. This plot also contains the current fit function as thick dashed lines. Below this plot, the residuals (difference between data and model) is shown in a second plot. Here the thick lines represent a running average over the fit functions. the plot style can be edited with the widgets above the plots (error/weight style, plot style, ...). </li>
  <li><b>lower/upper cut-off:</b> Below the plot you can limit the lag-time range, that is used for the fit (cut parts of the curve). </li>
  <li>At the bottom left of the window, a <b>fit parameter table</b> displays all currently selected files/RDRs and the according fit models together with all parameters. Each combination of  specific RDRs is called a <b>file set</b> and for each such file set, a fit can be performed.</li>
  <li>On the bottom right, several buttons and widgets allow to start a fit for the currently chosen set of files/RDRs.</li>
  <li>Above these buttons, a<b> list shows all available file sets</b>. If a fit has already been performed for a specific file set, it is displayed as a dark blue or black entry. Based on the last fit, QuickFit tries to guess other sets of RDRs from the project, which can also be fitted with the currently selected models. These "guessed" file sets are displayed in gray.</li>
</ul>
</p>



<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>$$see:See <a href="tutorial.html">the imFCCS fit tutorials</a> for a detailed walk-through of this plugin.$$</p>
<p>The basic workflow of this plugin is as follows:
<ol>
    <li>Ensure, that the three (or more) correlation curves from each measurement are grouped correctly (e.g. the ACF0, ACF1 and FCCS curve for a single measurement should be in the same RDR group). You can use the <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$/dlgeditgroupandrole.html">edit group, role and folder tool</a> of QuickFit to set these groups.<br><i>This is usually not necessary, when you used th QuickFit correlator, as it already sets the groups properly!</i></li>
    <li>Especially for cell data: Ensure, that the overview images are masked correctly!</li>
    <li>Set up the fit to the correct number of files/RDRs and choose the right fit models. Link the parameters as fit for you problem. For many common cases, there are shortcuts in the <b>Tools</b> menu. Also choose the type of fit weighting, fit algorithm and fit error estimation options.</li>
    <li>Fit the average run of the first of your datasets until the fit is good. </li>
    <li>The parameters you gain by the fit in the last step are usually also good starting values for your other measurements. So you can use these as initial parameters, by clicking <b>"Copy to Initial".</b> Also the plugin should have identified your other measurements (filesets) and should show them as grayed entries in the filesets list on the right. If not, ensure, that you properly grouped the files in step. You can always ask QuickFit to recognize possible filesets, by clicking on <b>Tools | Guess file sets ...</b>.</li>
    <li>With the new starting values, you can now try and fit all pixels in the current fileset. Use the button <b>Fit all Pixels</b> to do so and check the fits by randomly selecting a few pixels in the overview image. If the fits in these pixels are good, you can rpoceed. Otherwise you may have to set the starting values differently, or also change e.g. the parameter ranges of the fit parameters. Before doing these changes, you should <b>reset all pixels</b> and after setrings <b>fit all pixels</b> again.</li>
    <li>When you're sattisfied with the fit results of the first fileset, you can proceed to the others: Go to your next measurement (click one in the filesets list on the rhs) and fit that also. Possibly you'll have to change the initial values slightly.</li>
    <li>Repeat the fitting for all available filesets. (You can ue <b>"Fit all pixels &amp; filesets"</b> for that)</li>
    <li>The best way to get an overview of the fit results of an imFCCS fit is to open the RDRs by double-clicking them in the project. The <a href="$$plugin_info:helpdir:imaging_fcs$$/imfcs_ui.html">imFCS RDR editor</a> allows you to view the parameter images and also the parameter distirbutions and correlations. The <b>copy result stats.</b> option in that dialog also allows to summarize the fit results of several measurements/samples into a single table with averages/std.dev./... for each file.</li>
</ol></p>


<h2>Detailed description of the different functions</h2>
<p><ul>
  <li><b>Fit Current</b> fits the currently select pixel/run in the current file set</li>
  <li><b>Fit All Piels</b> fits all pixels/runs in the current file set</li>
  <li><b>Fit All Pixels Filesets</b> fits all pixels/runs in all available (also the guessed) file sets</li>
  <li><b>Save/Print Report</b> saves (PDF,PS,HTML,ODT) or prints a report, which contains all currently displayed plots amd the fit result table. Also all settings for the fit are included. </li>
  <li><b>Reset Current</b> Resets the fit results, that are currently displayed (current pixel/run + file set) to the initial values.</li>
  <li><b>Reset All pixels</b> resets the fit results in all pixels.</li>
  <li><b>Copy to Initial</b> tells the plugin to use the current fit results as initial values for all further fits.</li>
  <li><b>local/global iterations</b> if this is a number <i>N</i>&gt;0, the fit will iterate <i>N</i>-times over these setps:<ol><li>fit each model to each file/RDR locally</li><li>fir all files/RDRs globally using the values form the last step as initial values</li></ol>This procedure may improve convergence on difficult problems.</li>
  <li><b>repeat fits</b> if this is a number <i>N</i>&gt;1, the fit for each pixel will be repeated <i>N</i>-times, where each time, the result of the last fit run is used as initial value for the next. Often <i>N=3</i> is a good choice to improve convergence in imFCCS fits. The additionally required processing time is relatively low, as the fits typically already start with good initial conditions.</li>
  <li><b>don't fit masked pixels</b> if this is activated (default), only those pixels will be fitted, which are not masked out. Especially in fits of cells it is therefore advisable to mask all pixels, which do NOT belong to the cell, so processing time is reduced significantly. $$note: Typically fits take significantly longer, when no proper correlation functions is present, such as in the case of pixels outside a cell, which do  not show any non-vanishing correlation.$$</li>
  <li><b>save long result strings</b> If this is activated (by default not) additional information is stored for each RDR in the fit results (e.g. a string describing the fit results). This information is typically superfluous and only needed for debugging. Also it will significantly increase the project file size.<b> Therefore it is advisable to leave this deactiveated.</b></li>
  <li><b>Tools | save global fit config</b> save the fit models/files and current fit parameter presets from the fit parameter table into a configuration file, for reuse in other projects/plugin instances.</li>
  <li><a name="setresetparams"><a name="#setresetparams"><b>Tools | set/reset fit &parameters</b> sets a user-selectable fit parameter, its error and/or its fix-state in the current fileset, or in all fitted filesets. A dialog will open, in which you can select the parameter and choose, which properties should be changed. $$warning:This function is slow and might not work properly for some global parameters. If parameters are summarized to a global parameter, which have different names, you should each of these different parameters separately, using this function!$$</li>
