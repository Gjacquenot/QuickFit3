<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You can start an imFCCS evaluation, by adding an imFCCS evaluation item to your project (menu entry <tt>|Insert Evaluations|imFCCS Fit</tt> in the main window of QuickFit).</p>
<p><center><img src="./pic/ui_overview.png"></center>
The imFCCS plugin screen is separated into different parts:
<ul>
  <li>At the top of the window, you can select the fit algorithm and the data weighting to be used.</li>
  <li>In the center of the screen, an overview image of the measurement is displayed. Here you can also select (by clicking) the current pixel/run can be selected.</li>
  <li>The correlation curves of the selected pixel are displayed on the left of the overview image. This plot also contains the current fit function as thick dashed lines. Below this plot, the residuals (difference between data and model) is shown in a second plot. Here the thick lines represent a running average over the fit functions. the plot style can be edited with the widgets above the plots (error/weight style, plot style, ...). </li>
  <li>Below the plot you can limit the lag-time range, that is used for the fit (cut parts of the curve). </li>
</ul>
