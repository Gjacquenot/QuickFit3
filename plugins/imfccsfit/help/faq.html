  <a name="FAQ_WEIGHTING"><b>What do the fit weighting optins mean?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  See the help-page <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$/fcsfit_weighting.html">Fit Weighting</a> for detailed information on the weighting of fits. Basically these allow to use an error estimate for each measured point on the correlation curve, which determines how much the data point should influence the final result.

  <a name="FAQ_GLOBALFIT"><b>What is a global imFCCS fit?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  In a standard imFCS fit, there is exactly one correlation function (usually an autocorrelation) for each pixel. The fit then optimizes the parameters of a single model to best fit this correlation curve. In imFCCS measurements, several auto- and cross-correlation functions exist for each pixel. These curves are not independent, but partly determined by the same parameters (e.g. the focus volume parameters, or also the diffusion coefficients in a 2-color FCCS measurement, where the same double-labeled particles are observed in all color channels). Therefore the information from all these curves (e.g. two autocorrelations and a cross-correlation for two-color FCCS) can be used to better estimate the underlying model parameters. The (partly linked) parameters of several models are then optimized simultaneously to best fit all correlation curves in each pixel simultaneously.

  <a name="FAQ_FILESETS"><b>What are file-sets in the context of a global imFCCS fit?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  File sets are used to organize the global imaging FCCS fits. Each file set consists of a list of files and a fit function for each of these files. The global fits fit these functions to all files in the fileset simultaneously. They take the role of single RDRs/files in a global FCCS fit. This means, that you can perform a fit for (every pixel in) every fileset.

  <a name="FAQ_FITPRESETSREUSE"><b>How can I reuse a configuration of the global fit in another project?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  There are two possibilities: <ol>
    <li>Via Clipboard: In the project tree, you can copy the evaluation object (right-click the evaluation item and click on Copy) and then paste it into another project (again right-click the project tree and choose Paste). This will copy the fit models, parameter initial values, ranges, ...</li>
    <li>Via Configuration files: In the imFCCS fit editor, you can use the entries <b>load global fit config ...</b> and <b>save global fit config ...</b> from the menu <b>Tools</b>-menu. These save (and load) the fit models, parameter initial values, ranges and fix-settings into (from) a file on the harddisk.</li>
  </ol>

  <a name="FAQ_DELETEALL"><b>How can I delete all fit results, obtained from an imFCCS fit?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  In the imFCCS fit editor, there are two possibilities: <ol>
    <li>Click on the "Clear Everything" button</li>
    <li>Go to the Results tab and select all cells in the table. Then delete all these cells via the context-menu.</li>
  </ol>

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_PRESETCONFIG"><b>Do I have to configure the models and global parameters for every fit anew?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  No, QuickFit provides several presets for standard configurations/models, which you can find in the menu <b>Tools</b>. You can also save a configuration to a file and reload it later (<b>Tools | load global fit config ...</b> and <b>Tools | save global fit config ...</b>).
