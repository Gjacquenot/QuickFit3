        <title>$$local_plugin_name$$: Arrivaltime Histograms</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        $$qf_commondoc_header.start$$ $$qf_commondoc_header.end$$ 
<p>This tool will calculate histograms of the microtime (i.e. the picosecond-resolution time-tag part) in the TCSPC records.  The results will be imported into the QuickFit project as <a href="$$plugin_info:help:table$$">table RDRs</a>, which contain the histogram data and plots for each channel. YYou can choose to cut the input file into several segments. Then a histogram for each channel in each segment is calculated ans displayed.
</p>
<p>When the evaluation has finished, the project contains an RDR, like the following for the histograms:
<center><a name="lifetime_pic000"><img src="./pic/lifetime_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
This RDR contains a table with the histograms:
<center><a name="lifetime_pic001"><img src="./pic/lifetime_pic001.png" border="1">
</center>
and plots of the histograms:
<center><a name="lifetime_pic002"><img src="./pic/lifetime_pic002.png" border="1">
</center>
You can use the fitting facilities of the <a href="$$plugin_info:help:table$$">table plugin</a> to perform simple lifetime fitting (i.e. click on the "least squares fit" button at the lower-right of the window for any graph in the plot).
