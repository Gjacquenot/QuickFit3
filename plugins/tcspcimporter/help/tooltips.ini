TTTR="<b>Time-tagged, time-resolved</b> is a storage format for single-photon data. It stores a time-tag (i.e. the arrival-time) and additional flags (e.g. the input channel) for every photon. Typically the time-tag is split into two parts:<ul><li>the <b>macrotime</b> is the arrival time, measured with respect to the start of the experiment. This usually has a resolution of 1-100ns.</li><li>The <b>microtime</b> measres the arrival time of the photon with respect to a synchronization pulse. It usually has a resolution on the order of picoseconds. With this information, fluorescence lifetimes can be measured, if the reference pulse is synchronized to a short-pulsed excitation laser.</li></ul>"

TCSPC="<b>Time-correlated single-photon counting</b> is a (bio)physical, in which single photons are detected with an avalanche photodiode or a photo-multiplier and their exact arrival-times are measured. If the excitation of a fluorophore is done with a short-pulsed laser, the resulting data can be used to measure fluorescence lifetimes, by timing the photons with picosecond resolution with respect to the excitation pulses (reference)."
