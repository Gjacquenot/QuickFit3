cairo4qt, just like the name, implements a cairo based paint engine for Qt4's Arthur paint system.


Requirement:
Qt >= 4.2.0 (tested with 4.2.3)
cairo >= 1.4.0


Current Status:
1) support most cairo based paintengine features except ConicalGradientFill
2) not implement cairo based text draw functions, text display is slower
3) only support cairo's xlib/xlib-render backend, so just QWidget/QPixmap can use cairo4qt on linux system


Install:
1) add to Qt lib
   patch patch/qt-x11-opensource-src-4.2.3.patch to Qt 4.2.3 source, then rebuild Qt lib.
   
2) add to your app project
   add source file in src/ directory to project, modify QWidget based classes which you want to use cairo4qt
just like example/widget.h and example/widget.cpp


How to run:
   Normally, apps use Qt4's X11 paintengine. In order to use cairo4qt, run export QT_USE_CAIRO=1, then run qt apps.

Note:
   if cairo4qt is installed like 2), and want to compare the performance of cairo4qt with Qt4's X11 paintengine,
you shoud first run export QT_ONSCREEN_PAINT=1, to disable double buffer.
