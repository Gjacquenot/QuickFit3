		<p>This plugin uses the <a href="http://cairographics.org/">Cairo graphics library</a> to create PDF, EPS, PS and SVG files from any plot in QuickFit.</p>
		<p>This plugin currently has some limitations:<ul>
		  <li>There are two options for text rendering: The exporters with the name addition <i>"[editable text]"</i> export text in a way, that it is editable in graphics software afterwards. the exporters without this addition render text as polygons/paths, so the text is no longer editable in a vector graphics editing program, but the rendering can be more accurate!</li>
		  <li>no fill patterns (only colors) are supported at the moment</li>		  
		</ul>		
		</p>
