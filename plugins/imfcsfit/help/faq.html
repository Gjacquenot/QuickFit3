  <a name="FAQ_WEIGHTING"><b>What do the fit weighting optins mean?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  See the help-page <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$/fcsfit_weighting.html">Fit Weighting</a> for detailed information on the weighting of fits. Basically these allow to use an error estimate for each measured point on the correlation curve, which determines how much the data point should influence the final result.

  <a name="FAQ_CALIBRATION"><b>How can I perform an imagingFCS focal volume calibration?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  See <a href="./calibration.html">Performing an imFCS calibration</a> for a detailed description.<br>
  There is also a wizard, which leads you through the whole process, including correlation, which you find in the main-window menu entry <b>File | Project Wizards | Imaging FCS Calibration Wizard</b>

$$faq_answer$$
  See <a href="$$plugin_info:helpdir:imaging_fcs$$/tutorial_solution.html">imFCS analysis of beads in solution</a> and <a href="$$plugin_info:helpdir:imaging_fcs$$/tutorial_cell.html">imFCS analysis in a cell</a> for detailed tutorials on these tasks.

  <a name="FAQ_OVERLAY"><b>How can I create an overlay plot of several measured correlation cures?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
Use the tools in the menu <b>Tools | Overlay Plots</b> of the evaluation editor.
  See the <a href="tutorial_overlayplot.html">Tutorial on overlay plots</a> for a step-by-step description.

  <a name="FAQ_FILTER"><b>How can I filter the list of raw data records, displayed in the plugin screen?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Above the list (rhs of the evaluation window), there are two fields, that allow to filter the displayed RDRs
<center><a name="faq_pic000"><img src="./pic/faq_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
You can enter a simple filter expression there. then only those files will be displayed, which contain the given expression. As an example, if your project contains a full FCCS measurement with three RDRs per measurement (ACF0,ACF1 and FCCS), but you only want to fit ACF0-RDRs with this evaluation, simply enter ACF0 into the left field. the rhs filter-field allows to exclude all records, that do NOT contain the specified filter string. In addition you can use <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$qf3_qtregexp.html">regular expressions</a> for the filter strings.

  <a name="FAQ_FREEZE"><b>What can I do if a multi-threaded imagingFCS fit freezes my QuickFit?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  This situation should not occur, but if: This may sometimes happen, if the multi-threaded fit ends up in an (unintended) dead-lock. You can do several things:
  <ol>
    <li>set the maximum number of threads (in QuickFit's settings dialog) to a lower value (usually 2-4 works fine).</li>
    <li>if this happens for the <b>newMT</b> default variant of the fits, use the <b>MT</b> variant instead (click on the down-arrow on the rhs of the fit buttons to select a different method), which is slower but uses a different scheme for coordination between the different threads.</li>
    <li>use the slower non-threaded fit (click on the down-arrow on the rhs of the fit buttons to select a different method)</li>
  </ol>

  <a name="FAQ_GUESS"><b>How can I guess initial parameters for an imaging FCS fit?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  The imaging FCS plugin provides <a href="ui.html#guess">several methods to guess initial parameters</a> for a fit:
  <ol>
      <li>you can use automatic guessing of some of the parameters, if provided by the used fit model. This function can be performed by clicking on one of the buttons
      <center><a name="faq_pic002"><img src="./pic/faq_pic002.png" border="1">
      </center>
      below the fit parameter input widgets:
       <center><a name="faq_pic001"><img src="./pic/faq_pic001.png" border="1">
       </center>
      Then the plugin tries to guess some of the function parameters (e.g. the particle number $(N)$ from the amplitude of the correlation curve at low lag-times: $(1/g(\(tau\approx10^{-5}\mathrm{s}))$, or the decay time $(\tau_D)$ from the half-decay time of the measured curve) from the measured correlation curve.
        </li>
       <li>You can provide values for single parameters with "user-assisted parameter-guessing", by right-clicking on the curve-plot and then choosing the parameter to guess from the context-submenu <b>Estimate Parameters</b>:<center><img src="./pic/ui_pic000.png" border="1">
       </center>
       The guess is then based on the xy-position that you clicked within the plot.</li> 
  </ol>
  $$note:This functionality os actually implemented in the fit-function plugins, so its availablility depends on those plugins!$$
