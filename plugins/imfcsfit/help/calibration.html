     <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In typical, camera-based imFCS settings (e.g. using a Selective Plane Illumination Microscope, SPIM or a Total Internal Reflection Microscope, TIRF), the focus size is described by the Molecular Detection Function (MDF, the red "focal volume" in the figure above). The MDF is calculated from the point-spread function (PSF, blue in the figure above), which describes the focus size of the detection/illumination <u>optics</u> (wothout the camera/detector) and the finite pixel size of the camera:
     <ul>
       <li><i>For a SPIM:</i> The axial PSF extent $$math:\sigma_z$$ or $$math:w_z$$, which has to be measured independently, e.g. by a bead scan.</li>
       <li>The lateral PSF size $$math:\sigma_{xy}$$ or $$math:w_{xy}$$, which is determined by this calibration </li>
       <li>The pixel size $$math:a$$ which is determined by the size of the detector pixels and the magnification of the microscope and thus very well known.</li>
     </ul>
     With these variables the Molecular Detection Function (MDF) can be written as a convolution of the rectangular pixel with the PSF (parameterized by $$math:w_z$$ and $$math:w_{xy}$$):
      $$bmath:MDF(x,y,z)=Pixel(x,y,z)\ast PSF(x,y,z)=\int_{-a/2}^{a/2}\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} PSF(x-\xi, y-\mu, z)\;d\xi d\mu$$
     The actual form of the PSF (gaussian, gaussian beam, ...) is another question, but the above definition holds for all rectangular detectors. Still: Usually the PSF is assumed to be a 3D gaussian, as then the FCS correlation curves can usually be written in a closed form.$$REF_WOHLANDSPIMFCS$$</p>

     <p>For a typical microscope setup, the pixel size $$math:a$$ is very well known (due to the known magnification and camera specification). What is not really known is the size of the PSF, i.e.   $$math:w_z$$ and  $$math:w_{xy}$$. These parameters have to be determined by a calibration. The basic idea is to use a sample with known diffusion coefficient and then fit the measurements from this sample, with the diffusion coefficient fixed to the known value and $$math:w_{xy}$$ as a free fit parameter. This results in a good estimate of $$math:w_{xy}$$. On a SPIM, in addition $$math:w_z$$ has to be determined, which is not possible by a calibration (due to the low sensitivity of typical SPIM/TIRF-FCS fit models on $$math:w_z$$ for a given diffusion coefficient). A possible way is to perform a beadstack (i.e. a z-image stack of beads, immobilized in a stiff gel) and evaluate it by fitting a 3D-Gaussian function to each bead-image in the stack $$REF_SPIMFCS_CAM$$ $$REF_SPIMFCCS$$ $$REF_BEADSTACK_MATLAB$$. This calibration procedure is also typically used for confocal FCS. In imFCS the imaging information can be used to overcome the requirement of a sample of known diffusion coefficient: We can slowly increase the size of the MDF by binning several pixels into a "super-pixel". Then the size of the MDF is mainly determined by the pixel size and does not depend strongly on the size of the PSF. Under these conditions, a valid estimate of the diffusion coefficient can be made, even if the PSF-sizes are not yet known. Then this estimate can be used as fixed diffusion coefficient for the determination of $$math:w_{xy}$$ (see image above). </p> 
     
     

     
     <h2>Basic Procedure</h2>
          
     <p>The method outlined above is described in $$ref:Bag2012:$$ and $$ref:singh2013:$$ and works as follows:
     
    <ol>
        <li>For a SPIM: predetermine $$math:w_z$$ (this is not required for TIRF-FCS)</li>
        <li>ACF curves are created for increasing pixel-binnings, i.e. increasing pixels sizes $$math:a$$. </li>
        <li>For each binning a diffusion coefficient $$math:D_a$$ is determined from a fit. For $$math:a\gg w_{xy}$$ the measured diffusion coefficient should get independent of $$math:w_{xy}$$, as the pixel size $$math:a$$ dominates the MDF size. So the diffusion coefficient measured at very high binnings can be assumed to be the true diffusion coefficient (if $$math:a$$ and $$mathw_z$$ are known with good accuracy).</li>
        <li>Finally $$math:w_{xy}$$ can be determined from a fit with the diffusion coefficient fixed to the value determined in step 2.</li>
    </ol>
    In order to determine the true diffusion coefficient in step 2, we need an estimate for $$math:w_{xy}$$, as this is a parameter of the model function for the ACF. As this measure is not known, one tries several different values for $$math:w_{xy}$$. The typically results as these are obtained:
    <center>
    <a name="calibration_pic000"><img src="./pic/calibration_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
  Then one can get the $$math:D$$ for the final fit by averaging over the results at large $$math:a$$. The final fit with $$math:D$$ fixed and $$math:w_{xy}$$ a free parameter then typically resembles a result like this:
<center>
    <a name="calibration_pic001"><img src="./pic/calibration_pic001.png" border="1">
</center>
  The $$math:w_{xy}$$ value at the smalles binning, or an average over all values can be used as final calibration value.
     </p>
