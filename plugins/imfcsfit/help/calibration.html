     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <center><a name="calibration_pic002"><img src="./pic/calibration_pic002.png" border="1">
     </center>
     
    <p>In typical, camera-based imFCS settings (e.g. using a Selective Plane Illumination Microscope, SPIM or a Total Internal Reflection Microscope, TIRF), the focus size is described by the Molecular Detection Function (MDF, the red "focal volume" in the figure above). The MDF is calculated from the point-spread function (PSF, blue in the figure above), which describes the focus size of the detection/illumination <u>optics</u> (wothout the camera/detector) and the finite pixel size of the camera:
     <ul>
       <li><i>For a SPIM:</i> The axial PSF extent $$math:\sigma_z$$ or $$math:w_z$$, which has to be measured independently, e.g. by a bead scan.</li>
       <li>The lateral PSF size $$math:\sigma_{xy}$$ or $$math:w_{xy}$$, which is determined by this calibration </li>
       <li>The pixel size $$math:a$$ which is determined by the size of the detector pixels and the magnification of the microscope and thus very well known.</li>
     </ul>
     With these variables the Molecular Detection Function (MDF) can be written as a convolution of the rectangular pixel with the PSF (parameterized by $$math:w_z$$ and $$math:w_{xy}$$):
      $$bmath:MDF(x,y,z)=Pixel(x,y,z)\ast PSF(x,y,z)=\int_{-a/2}^{a/2}\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} PSF(x-\xi, y-\mu, z)\;d\xi d\mu$$
     The actual form of the PSF (gaussian, gaussian beam, ...) is another question, but the above definition holds for all rectangular detectors. Still: Usually the PSF is assumed to be a 3D gaussian, as then the FCS correlation curves can usually be written in a closed form.$$REF_WOHLANDSPIMFCS$$</p>

     <p>For a typical microscope setup, the pixel size $$math:a$$ is very well known (due to the known magnification and camera specification). What is not really known is the size of the PSF, i.e.   $$math:w_z$$ and  $$math:w_{xy}$$. These parameters have to be determined by a calibration. The basic idea is to use a sample with known diffusion coefficient and then fit the measurements from this sample, with the diffusion coefficient fixed to the known value and $$math:w_{xy}$$ as a free fit parameter. This results in a good estimate of $$math:w_{xy}$$. On a SPIM, in addition $$math:w_z$$ has to be determined, which is not possible by a calibration (due to the low sensitivity of typical SPIM/TIRF-FCS fit models on $$math:w_z$$ for a given diffusion coefficient). A possible way is to perform a beadstack (i.e. a z-image stack of beads, immobilized in a stiff gel) and evaluate it by fitting a 3D-Gaussian function to each bead-image in the stack $$REF_SPIMFCS_CAM$$ $$REF_SPIMFCCS$$ $$REF_BEADSTACK_MATLAB$$. This calibration procedure is also typically used for confocal FCS. In imFCS the imaging information can be used to overcome the requirement of a sample of known diffusion coefficient: We can slowly increase the size of the MDF by binning several pixels into a "super-pixel". Then the size of the MDF is mainly determined by the pixel size and does not depend strongly on the size of the PSF. Under these conditions, a valid estimate of the diffusion coefficient can be made, even if the PSF-sizes are not yet known. Then this estimate can be used as fixed diffusion coefficient for the determination of $$math:w_{xy}$$ (see image above). </p> 
     
     

     
     <h2>Basic Procedure</h2>
          
     <p>The method outlined above is described in $$ref:Bag2012:$$ and $$ref:singh2013:$$ and works as follows:
     
    <ol>
        <li>For a SPIM: predetermine $$math:w_z$$ (this is not required for TIRF-FCS)</li>
        <li>ACF curves are created for increasing pixel-binnings, i.e. increasing pixels sizes $$math:a$$. </li>
        <li>For each binning a diffusion coefficient $$math:D_a$$ is determined from a fit. For $$math:a\gg w_{xy}$$ the measured diffusion coefficient should get independent of $$math:w_{xy}$$, as the pixel size $$math:a$$ dominates the MDF size. So the diffusion coefficient measured at very high binnings can be assumed to be the true diffusion coefficient (if $$math:a$$ and $$mathw_z$$ are known with good accuracy).</li>
        <li>Finally $$math:w_{xy}$$ can be determined from a fit with the diffusion coefficient fixed to the value determined in step 2.</li>
    </ol>
    In order to determine the true diffusion coefficient in step 2, we need an estimate for $$math:w_{xy}$$, as this is a parameter of the model function for the ACF. As this measure is not known, one tries several different values for $$math:w_{xy}$$. The typically results as these are obtained:
    <center>
    <a name="calibration_pic000"><img src="./pic/calibration_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
  Then one can get the $$math:D$$ for the final fit by averaging over the results at large $$math:a$$. The final fit with $$math:D$$ fixed and $$math:w_{xy}$$ a free parameter then typically resembles a result like this:
<center>
    <a name="calibration_pic001"><img src="./pic/calibration_pic001.png" border="1">
</center>
  The $$math:w_{xy}$$ value at the smalles binning, or an average over all values can be used as final calibration value.
     </p>
     <p>The rest of this pages describes a step-by-step instruction to perform an imFCS calibration.</p>
 
     

<h2>Tutorial: SPIM/TIRF-FCS</h2>
    
     <h3>Acquiring Data</h3>
     <p>First perform a measurement of the calibration sample, e.g. 0.5nM fluorescent latex spheres (diameter 100nm) in water with your lightsheet microscope, or a supported bilayer with a fluorescent dye on a TIRF microscope. You should acquire about 20x20 pixels in the center of the field of view (FOV) of you microscope. </p>
$$warning:Ensure, that no aggregates were present during the measurement of the beads, since these might lead to problems and wronlgy estimated parameters in the calibration!$$
<p>On a SPIM you will also have to determine the axial PSF-size $$math:w_z$$, e.g. by a bead scan (see <a href="http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/quickfit/beadscan.html">http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/quickfit/beadscan.html</a>).</p>
     $$startbox_note$$For testing purposes, a dataset for calibration is available from <a href="http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/quickfit/examples.html">http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/quickfit/examples.html</a> as <b>calibration_tetraspec_2014_04_03.zip</b>. This package contains a SPIM-FCS measurement with 100nm TetraSpec beads, which can be used for this tutorial. The longitudinal PSF-size was determined to be $$math:w_z=1552nm$$. The camera pixel size was $$math:a=400nm$$.
     $$endbox$$
     <h3>Image Series Correlation</h3>
     <p>Then create an empty project and use the <a href="$$plugin_info:helpdir:imaging_fcs$$/imfcs_usage.html#correlating">imFCS correlation tool</a> to calculate the ACFs of the acquired image series for different binnings. In this tool the "Add Series" button allows to add several binnings (typically use binning=1,2,3,4,5) with one click. Finally return to your QuickFit project and check the imported data. If everything is fine (good curves, few outliers, mask the outliers, ...) you may proceed with the next step.</p>
     <p>For the data, mentioned above you can use a setting of the correlator as follows:
     <ul>
         <li>tinyTIFF image reader</li>         
         <li>no bleach correction (beads don't bleach)</li>
         <li>binning 1-5</li>
         <li>crop the central 20x6 pixels</li>
         <li>direct correlation, with averaging and 5 segments</li>
         
     </ul>
     <center><a name="calibration_pic003"><img src="./pic/calibration_pic003.png" border="1">
     </center>
     Then click on <b>add series job</b> and set it to binning=1..5 as follows:
     <center><a name="calibration_pic004"><img src="./pic/calibration_pic004.png" border="1">
     </center>
     
     </p>
     <h3>Calibration</h3>
     <p>
     The following steps can conveniently be controlled by the "imFCS calibration Wizard", which leads you step-by-step through the calibration. It is available in the menu <code>Tools|imFCS Calibration Tool|<b>Calbration Wizard</b></code>.
     </p><p>
      <ol>
         <li>Now you'll have to add imFCS fit objects that fits $$math:D(a, w_{xy})$$: Use <code>Data Items|Insert Evaluation|imagingFCS Calibration Tool|<b>0: add imFCS calibration fits</b></code> and enter a series of test-$$math:w_{xy}$$ values surrounding the expected $$math:w_{xy}$$ value (e.g. if we expect $$math:w_{xy}\approx 600nm$$, you could use $$math:w_{xy}= 400nm, 500nm, 600nm, 700nm, 800nm$$. Also enter the value of $$math:w_z$$ you determined before.<center><a name="calibration_pic005"><img src="./pic/calibration_pic005.png" border="1">
</center>Then a click on "OK" will create one imFCS fit object for each $$math:w_{xy}$$ you entered. Now you'll have to fit every run/pixel in each of these fit evaluations. Check in each that a proper model is selected and $$math:w_{xy}$$ and $$math:a$$ are set properly and fixed. 
$$startbox_note$$
For the calibration of a SPIM-FCS measurement you should use the model <a href="$$fitfunction:help:fcs_spim_diffe2_newveff$$">$$fitfunction:name:fcs_spim_diffe2_newveff$$</a><br>and for TIRF-FCS calibration the model <a href="$$fitfunction:help:fcs_tir_diffe2$$">$$fitfunction:name:fcs_tir_diffe2$$</a>. In the TIRF case you won't have to supply $$math:w_z$$, so ignore this input widget.
$$endbox$$</li>
         <li>The fitting can be done automatically with the tool <code>Data Items|Insert Evaluation|imagingFCS Calibration Tool|<b>1: fit all D's</b></code> which will open one evaluation object after the other and perform the fit!</li>
         <li>Now you can use <code>Tools|imagingFCS Calibration Tool|<b>2 Collect D data</b></code> to create <a href="#calibration_pic000">the plot</a> of  $$math:D(a, w_{xy})$$. The plot will be inserted as <a href="../qfrdrtable/table.html">table object</a> with an associated plot. 
<center><img src="pic/calibration_pic000.png"></center>The tool will then give you the possibility to select a binning at which to take the average $$math:D$$ for the final fit and insert an object for the final $$math:w_{xy}$$-fit.</li>
         <li>Now you need to open the fit object created at the end of the last step and make sure that $$math:D, a$$ are fixed and $$math:w_{xy}$$ is free. Then fit all runs/pixels again. A final click on <code>Tools|imagingFCS Calibration Tool|<b>3 Collect wxy data</b></code> will then create the <a href="#calibration_pic001">second plot</a> and add it and its data to the table object created above. From this object you can then read the calibrated $$math_w_{xy}$$.
<center><img src="pic/calibration_pic001.png"></center>Usually the best estimate for $$math:w_{xy}$$ is the value, determined at the smallest binning, since there the fit model is most sensitive to $$math:w_{xy}$$.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>The two tools used above will scan the currently opened project and find those evaluation objects and raw data records used for the calibration. Tool 1 (step 2) extracts the average and standard deviation of the $$math:D$$ extracted from the fit. It also leaves out masked pixels! To offer a list of binnings to choose from the true $$math:D$$ it then averages the $$math:D$$ resulting from the fits at different binnings. The second tool averages over the $$math:w_{xy}$$ obtained from the last fits. It also ignores the masked pixels.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h2>Tutorial: SPIM/TIRF-FCCS, or dual-color microscope</h2>
      <p>In the case of a dual-color microscope (as e.g. used for SPIM-FCCS), the two color channels are often imaged in parallel, using a dual-view optics, or two cameras. Here the two color channels are usually calibrated separately. For a dual-view, a single frame form a measurement usually looks like this:
<center><a name="calibration_pic006"><img src="./pic/calibration_pic006.png" border="1">
</center>
The calibration is done exactly, as described above, but the cropping should select the central region (20x20 pixels) in the left image half for the green channel and the central region (20x20 pixels) in the right image half, i.e.:
<ul>
    <li>green/left: x=22...41, y=0..19</li>
    <li>red/right: x=86...105, y=0..19</li>
</ul>
As an additional test of your microscope alignment, you can check whether the reference diffusion coefficients determined in step 4 (see above) are equal (within their errors) for both clor channels.
