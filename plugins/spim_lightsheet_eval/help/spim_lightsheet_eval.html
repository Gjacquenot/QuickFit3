  <title>Plugin: SPIM Lightsheet Analysis</title>
  </head>
  <body>
		$$qf_commondoc_header.start$$ $$qf_commondoc_header.end$$ 

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This plugin performs an analysis for a set of lightsheet x-scans with a 45° mirror. I.e. it expects image stacks where each frame contains an image of the lightsheet. Usually a 45° mirror is inserted into the SPIM microscope to directly reflect the lightsheet onto the camera. Then the mirror is moved by a distance &Delta;z and another image is taken. It is also possible to evaluate an image stack with several color channels. Then the plugin allows to compare the parameters of each of the color channels.</p>
		<p>The plugin fits a model function (usually a gaussian or a slit function) to each row (or column) of each frame. The fit results are averaged for each frame. The resultant mean and standard deviation is then displayed versus the position of the mirror.</p>

		<h2>User Interface</h2>
		<p><ol>
		  <li>After loading an image stack and inserting a SPIM Lightsheet Analysis evaluation, open the evaluation and select the lightsheet</li>
		  <li>Now select a fit model and a fit algorithm to use.</li>
		  <li>Enter the shift of the mirror in nanometers as &Delta;z and the pixel size as &Delta;x.</li>
		  <li>select whether to fit to rows (vertical lightsheet) or to columns (horizontal lightsheet)</li>
		  <li>click on "Fit Current" to perform all fits for the current file.</li>
		  <li>In the tab "Preview &amp; Single Fits" you will see some intermediate fit results and may (after the fit completed) explore the fit to each row/column in each frame and color channel.</li>
		  <li>The second tab "Stack Fit Results" summarizes all fit results.</li>
