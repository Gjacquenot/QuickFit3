$$faq_answer$$
  If you used a camera for data acquisition, the molecular detection efficiency (MDF) of the microscope is often described by a convolution of a rectangular (square) pixel (pixel size $(a)$ in the image plane), which is convolved with a 3-dimensional Gaussian function, which approximates the point-spread function (PSF). These models may then be used (they are all marked by the name addition <tt>rect. pixel</tt>):
