<h2>Description</h2>
$$note:This driver relies on the Andor SDK2, which supports the iXon/Clara/... range of cameras. It cannot be used to control Andor sCMOS cameras that are controlled by the SDK3 only!$$
<p>This plugin controls cameras connected to the computer and controlled by the <a href="http://www.andor.com/software/sdk/">Andor camera SDK</a>. 
$$note:In order to use this plugin, you need the Andor driver DLLs, which are present either in the Driver, SDK installation directory, or e.g. the Solis installation directory. Make sure these directories are in the windows search path, otherwise the plugin cannot be loaded. <i>If you need more extended debug output for the plugins, run quickfit with the command line option <tt>--verboseplugin</tt> and check QuickFit's main log for error messages (search for "Andor", pressing Ctrl+F)</i>. On Linux you'll nedd the Linux drivers/SDK to use this plugin. If you want to develop software for Andor cameras, you will need a license for the Andor SDK 2, which you'll have to purchase from Andor (usually not included with the camera).$$ 
</p>

<h2>Supported Features</h2>
<p>This driver supports all Andor cameras accessible by the ver. 2.xx SDK. It was developed using version 2.88.30003.0 of the SDK on windows (32bit, 64bit version never tested) and Linux (64bit). We tested the driver with an Andor iXon X3 860 (DU860_BV). This driver supports these features of the ANdor SDK:
<ul>
  <li>camera shutter (global settings over the Extensions menu)</li>
  <li>sensor cooler (global settings over the Extensions menu)</li>
  <li>camera fan (global settings over the Extensions menu)</li>
  <li>EM Gain, but not the extended EM gain</li>
  <li>region of interest (ROI) and full-frame acquisition</li>
  <li>horizontal/vertical binning</li>
  <li>frame transfer mode</li>
  <li>setting of exposure time</li>
  <li>image modes:<ul>
    <li><i>imaging:</i> kinetic image mode (with cycles and accumulations)</li>
    <li><i>full vertical binning:</i> FVB mode, i.e. all rows in the selected ROI are summed. The ROI has to reside at the bottom of the image/sensor.</li>
    <li><i>cropped mode:</i> here the whole sensor up to the ROI has to be darkened (e.g. using a slit in an image plane of a microscope) and only the ROI (which has to reside at the bottom of the image/sensor) is read; without blanking out the rest of the sensor.</li>
  </ul></li>    
  <li>baseline clamp</li>
  <li>selecting an ADC channel</li>
  <li>pre-amplifier gain</li>
  <li>setting horizontal/vertical shift speed and vertical shift amplitude</li>
  <li>trigger modes:<ul>
    <li><i>Internal</i> (default)</li>
    <li><i>External</i></li>
    <li><i>External Start</i></li>
    <li><i>External Exposure (Bulb)</i></li>
  </ul>In all modes the trigger signals may or may not be inverted.</li>
  <li>Output filetypes:<ul>
    <li><i>16-bit TIFF:</i> (default) creates uncompressed multi-frame TIFF files using a hand-woven implementation of the TIFF format ("tinyTIFFWriter"). This allows to write more than 65535 frames into each TIFF file, which is not possible in the Andor-TIFF mode. The TIFF implementation is optimized for speed. The only limitation that applies is the maximum filesize of 4GB for TIFF files (they use 32-bit pointers internally). </li>
    <li><i>16-bit TIFF (spooling):</i> writes 16-bit TIFF files using the Andor driver's TIFF implementation ("Spooling mode")</li>
    <li><i>Andor SIF (spooling):</i> writes Andor SIF files using the Andor driver's implementation ("Spooling mode")</li>
    <li><i>16-bit FITS (spooling):</i> writes 16-bit FITS files using the Andor driver's FITS implementation ("Spooling mode")</li>
    <li><i>16-bit Raw:</i> writes the images one after the other into a binary file. No header information is stored. The dataformat is 16-bit unsigned integer and the byte order is the same as on your acquisition system. You should be able to easily read this file format with any available software or handwritten program.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h2>OS-specific Topics</h2>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>On windows: make sure that the required SDK DLLs are in a directory where QuickFit will find them (either the QuickFit base directory, or a directory in the Windows PATH variable, or the Windows system directory)! Basically just install the drivers and add the directory to the windows PATH environment variable. On Win32 you'll need <tt>ATMCD32D.H</tt> and on win64 <tt>ATMCD64D.H</tt>.</p>
<p><b>Compiling this driver with MinGW on Windows:</b> As QuickFit 3 relies on <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW (gcc for Windows)</a> as a compiler, and Andor does not provide link libraries for this compiler, a solution has been created that extracts the link library from the header file directly. This solution uses a bash shell script <tt>create_testcpp.sh</tt> which can be found in the QuickFit 3 <tt>extlibs/andor_win32</tt> directory. In addition you will need the header file <tt>ATMCD32D.H</tt> and DLL <tt>ATMCD32D.DLL</tt> issued with your copy of the Andor SDK, which you have to copy to the same directory as the shell script. You can then call <tt>create_testcpp.sh</tt> manually from a bash shell, as installed in your MinGW trunk by the MSYS tools (also available at the <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW homepage</a>). The script will "parse" the header file and create a dummy C-program that calls every function in the header with dummy parameters. The error messages that gcc will produce when compiling this script can then be parsed to build a proper link library for the Andor SDK (called <tt>libandor.a</tt>). This rather nasty procedure is necessary, as MinGW and Microsoft compilers have different calling conventions and "decorated names" for functions in DLLs and the Andor DLLs do not allow to use the standard tools to derive link libraries.

<h3>Linux</h3>
<h4>Installing Andor SDK on Linux</h4>
<p>
$$note:The following steps have been tested with an Andor iXon X3 860 on a Scientific Linux 7.1 (3.10.0-229.14.1.el7.x86_64) and the Andor SDK2, version 2.95.30003. Please contact Andor if you have problems connecting to your camera, or installing the SDK.$$
<ol>
    <li>Obtain a current version of the andor SDK from Andor</li>
    <li>unpack into your home-directory, e.g. into <tt>~/andor/</tt> and rund the installer script, as proposed by Andor (i.e. change into superuser mode using <tt>su</tt> and run <tt>install_andor</tt>. Follow all instructions on the screen.</li>
    <li>As proposed by Andor, generate the <tt>detector.ini</tt> file by copying the appropriate template: $$codeexample:cp /usr/local/etc/andor/DetectorTemplate.ini /usr/local/etc/andor/detector.ini$$For our camera, no editing of the <tt>detector.ini</tt> file was necessary.</li>
    <li>Assuming that you computer has more than 3GB of RAM, you'll have to "burn a hole" into the memory for Andor to use. To do so, use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt"><tt>memmap</tt> kernel parameter</a> (this is also described in the file <tt>INSTALL</tt> of the Andor SDK. First edit the (here grub) boot-configuration of your Linux to add the new kernel parameter:
$$codeexample:nano /etc/default/grub$$ 
In that file, add <code>memmap=8M\\\$1024M</code> to the line <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=" ...</code>, which will reserve a block of 8MB at the position 1024MB. In order for this configuration change to take effect, you have to rebuild the grub scripts by calling $$codeexample:grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg$$ or an appropriate variant for your system (see the GRUB documentation for details!!!).</li>
    <li>Now you also have to tell the Andor driver where that memory hole is. This is done (as proposed by andor) by editing the file <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt> and editing the line that loads the Andor driver to
        $$codeexample:sh /etc/andordrvlx_load DMA_MODE=1 DMA_ADDRESS=1024 DMA_SIZE=8$$
        Here <tt>DMA_ADDRESS</tt> and <tt>DMA_SIZE</tt> give the position of the memory to use for DMA-transfer. The basic version of the line should already be present, as it is added by the Andor SDK install script (see above). On our Linux it was still necessary to set the executable permission bits of this file by calling (this was proposed INSIDE the file!!!):
$$codeexample:chmod +x /etc/rc.local<br>
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local$$
    </li>
    <li>Now restart the system. If the driver was loaded correctly, a call of
    $$codeexample: lsmod | grep andor  $$
    should give an output which contains <tt>andordrvlx</tt>. If you encounter any problems, contact Andor for help!
     </li>
</ol>


</p>

<h4>Alternative Non-Standard Option to load driver via <tt>udev</tt></h4>
<p>On Linux after installing the SDK you will have to make the camera known to the system using a udev rules file <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-spim.rules</code> with contents like this:
     <blockquote><tt>
SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{vendor}=="0x149a", ATTR{device}=="0x0005", RUN+="/usr/sbin/andordrvlx_load"
     </tt></blockquote> If QuickFit cannot connect to the camera (this might e.g. happen when the driver QuickFit crashed) it sometimes helps to reload the driver using:     <blockquote><tt>
rmmod andordrvlx<br>
andordrvlx_load
     </tt></blockquote>
The command <code>lsmod</code> shall return something like <code>andordrvlx</code> when the driver was loaded successfully.
