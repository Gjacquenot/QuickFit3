	 <p>This plugin controls cameras connected to the computer and controlled by the <a href="http://www.andor.com/software/sdk/">Andor camera SDK</a>. 
Note that you need to purchase the Andor SDK separately, as this driver will only work together with the SDK. 

<p>On windows: make sure that the required SDK DLLs are in a directory where QUickFit will find them (either the QuickFit base directory, or a directory in the Windows PATH variable, or the Windows system directory!</p>
<p>On Linux after installing the SDK you will have to make the camera known to the system using a udev rules file <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-spim.rules</code> with contents like this:
	 <blockquote><tt>
SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{vendor}=="0x149a", ATTR{device}=="0x0005", RUN+="/usr/sbin/andordrvlx_load"
	 </tt></blockquote> If QuickFit cannot connect to the camera (this might e.g. happen when the driver QuickFit crashed) it sometimes helps to reload the driver using:	 <blockquote><tt>
rmmod andordrvlx<br>
andordrvlx_load
	 </tt></blockquote>
The command <code>lsmod</code> shall return something like <code>andordrvlx</code> when the driver was loaded successfully.
