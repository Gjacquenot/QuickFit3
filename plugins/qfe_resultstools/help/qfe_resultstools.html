		<h2>Description</h2>
		This plugin assembles a set of tools that work with evaluation results. It is e.g. possible to calculate new results from already existing results.
		
		<a name="calctool"><h2>Results Calculator</h2>
		This tool allows to calculate a new result from existing results. You can select any two results A and B from the project and give an arbitrary math expression, containing A and B, which is then evaluated. The expression parser uses a standard syntax for math expressions, which is defined in <a href="$$mainhelpdir$$mathparser.html">expression parser docuemntation</a>. <ul>
		  <li>If both results are vectors then a new vector is created by calculating the expression item-wise.</li>
		  <li>If both results are numbers the result is calculated by evaluating the expression once.</li>
		  </ul>
		The result of this calculation is stored in the FIRST selected record  and under the name entered at the bottom of the dialog.
