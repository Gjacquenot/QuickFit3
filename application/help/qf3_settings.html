</head>
<body>
$$qf_commondoc_header.start$$  $$qf_commondoc_header.end$$ 
<p> This dialog allows to set several options that change how QuickFit looks and operates.
<ol>
  <li><strong>View &amp; Language</strong><ul>
    <li><i>Language:</i> If translations of QuickFit are installed you can select one here. Note that you will have to restart QuickFit before the translation takes full effect.</li>
    <li><i>Style/Stylesheet:</i> Here you can select different styling options for QuickFit</li>
    <!--<li><i>:</i></li>-->

  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Parallelization</strong><ul>
    <li><i>Maximum Number of Threads:</i> Specifies how many threads may be started by QuickFit for parallel processing (optional). You should set this to a number equal or slightly smaller to the number of processor cores, your computer has.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Autosave</strong><ul>
    <li><i>autosave project every x minutes:</i> specifies the autosave interval for the project</li>
    <li><i>ask user to save project after first edit:</i> If this option is activated, QuickFit will ask the user to save the crrent project, right after the first record/evaluation has been added.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Debugging</strong><ul>
    <li><i>show additional debug messages in main window:</i> If this is activated, additional debug output (e.g. from the Qt library) is shown on the main window in an additional "Debug Log" tab. This debug outout is written to <tt>quickfit3_qdebug.log</tt> in the QuickFit user settings directory. If this function is deactivated these outputs are redirected to the standard console output. If you have stability problems with Quickfit, it might help to deactivate this function (especially on Linux).</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>further configuration possibilities are provided by plugins and are documented with them:
