<h2>QuickFit $$version$$ Projects (Data Model)</h2>
<p>Quickfit $$version$$ is based on a very simple and versatile data model:</p>
<center><img src="./pic/qf3_datamodel.png"></center>
<p>The raw data is (usually) loaded from external files. Inside QuickFit the raw data is represented as <b>"<a href="pop:RDR">raw data records</a>"</b>. If the data is transformed by QuickFit, this either happens soleily in memory or the transformed is saved in a separate file, so the input files are <u>never</u> altered by QuickFit. Each raw data record (may e.g. correspond to a file or a part of a file) may be annotated by the user with a name (used to access the raw data record program-wide, by default this is usually simpy the filename), a description (free text) and a set of "properties" which are <tt>&lt;name, value&gt;</tt> pairs (these could e.g. save the temperature or other settings at which the measurement was taken). These are the only data-independent properties available. Additional possibilities may be implemented by a special raw data plugin and their documentation can be found <a href="plugin_list.html">there</a>.</p>
<p>In addition <b>"evaluation objects"</b> exist in QuickFit which encapsulate a data evaluation method (e.g. a fit algorithm together with a certain model and settings for those). These may be applied to a raw data record. the results will usually be saved together with the raw data record (as a "evaluation result set"). You may create and use as many evaluation objects as you want. This way you can e.g. compare the fit of a given raw data record to different models, as the results are save specific to each evaluation object, not only the method itself.</p>
<p>Quickfit summarizes these raw data records and the data evaluations in a project. The project can be saved (<tt>.qfp</tt> file), so you can reload it without loosing any data lateron. The project file will usually not contain the data, but only references to the external files (as relative links, so you can simply copy the project+files between different computers, as long as their relative positions stays the same). But it will contain all evaluation results, annotations and properties.<br>
The projects are saved in an .qfp file, which contains the data in the (mostly) human-readable XML format. So you can still extract data, even if QuickFit is not available, as most tags in the qfp-file are self-explanatory. </p>


<h2>QuickFit $$version$$ Project File Format</h2>
<p>QuickFit $$version$$ projects are stored to disk as XML files (*.qfp files). In addition it is possible to compress those files on-line by saving the project as a *.qfpz file. The compression algorithm is GZip.
</p>
<p><blockquote><small><b>A note for developers:</b> Most of the data in these files are human-readable, except some results (especially vectors and matrices), which are saved as base64- or hex-encoded binary data.</small></blockquote>
