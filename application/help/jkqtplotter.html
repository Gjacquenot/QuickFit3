<p> At many places inside QuickFit plots are used. Many of these plot displays use the same source code in order to draw the plots. They also feature a basic set of possibilities to interact with the user. Note however, that some of these possibilities may be deachtivated at some places, or you find them somewhere else. In those cases the online-help will explain what is not usable. Commonly all plots support these features:
</p>
<h2>Toolbar</h2>
<p>If you move the mouse to the top left corner of the plot widget, a toolbar will appear (and disappear, if the mouse moves away from it). It provides several possibilities:
    <ul>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_saveplot.png"> <b>Save Plot:</b> saves the plot as displayed on the screen as image (PNG,BMP, JPEG, ...), PostScript or PDF file</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_print.png"> <b>Print Plot:</b> print the plot</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_savedata.png"> <b>Save Data:</b> saves the data used to draw the plot as a CSV, SYLK or DIF files which may be read by other programs (like scientific plot programs, spreadsheet applications, ...)</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_zoomall.png"> <b>Zoom All:</b> reset the zoom to a state where all elements of the plot are visible</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_zoomin.png"> <b>Zoom In:</b> zoom into the center of the plot</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_zoomout.png"> <b>Zoom out:</b> Zoom out of the plot</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Zooming</h2>
<p>You can zoom into the graphs on several ways:
<ul>
  <li>You can draw a zoom rectangle onto the plot, by pressing the left mouse button on the first corner and then pull the rectangle to the desired size. Then you have to release the left mouse button and the plot range will change accoring to your selection</li>
  <li>You can use the mousewheel to zoom into the plot. The plot range will be expanded/reduced around the current mouse cursor position as the new plot center.</li>
</ul>
</p>
