<p> 
At many places inside QuickFit plots are used. 
Many of these plot displays use the same source code in order to draw the plots. 
They also feature a basic set of possibilities to interact with the user. 
Note however, that some of these possibilities may be deachtivated at some places, or you find them somewhere else. 
In those cases the online-help will explain what is not usable. Commonly all plots support these features:
</p>
<h2>Toolbar</h2>
<p>If you move the mouse to the top left corner of the plot widget, a toolbar will appear (and disappear, if the mouse moves away from it). It provides several possibilities:
    <ul>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_saveplot.png"> <b>Save Plot:</b> saves the plot as displayed on the screen as image (PNG,BMP, JPEG, ...), PostScript or PDF file</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_print.png"> <b>Print Plot:</b> print the plot</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_savedata.png"> <b>Save Data:</b> saves the data used to draw the plot as a CSV, SYLK or DIF files which may be read by other programs (like scientific plot programs, spreadsheet applications, ...)</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_copydata.png"> <b>Copy Data to Clipboard:</b> copies the data used for the plot(s) to the clipboard, so it can be pasted into spreadsheet programs like excel as a table</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_copymatlab.png"> <b>Copy Data to Clipboard for Matlab:</b> copies the data used for the plot(s) as a Matlab script to the clipboard. Each column is output as a separate vector in the script with a unique name</li>
	  <li><img src=":/jkqtp_showplotdata.png"> <b>Show Plot Data:</b> opens a new window, which contains the plot data as a table</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_zoomall.png"> <b>Zoom All:</b> reset the zoom to a state where all elements of the plot are visible</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_zoomin.png"> <b>Zoom In:</b> zoom into the center of the plot</li>
	  <li><img src=":/images/jkqtp_zoomout.png"> <b>Zoom out:</b> Zoom out of the plot</li>
	  <li><a name="tablerdr"><img src=":/libqf3widgets/qfplotter_copytotable.png"> <b>copy plot data to table RDR:</b> This function can be used to create a <a href="$$plugin_info:help:table$$">table raw data record</a> from the current plot. The record will contain all data necessary to create the plot and the plot itself. This alows to easily save a certain plot inside the project. <br>After activating this function, a dialog will open that allows to select what data is copied and where it is copied:
                 <center><a name="jkqtplotter_pic000"><img src="./pic/jkqtplotter_pic000.png" border="1"></center>First you will have to choose, whether to add the data (and the plot) to an existing table or whether to create a new one. <br> Then you can choose a prefix, which is added to every column inserted into the table. This is especially useful, if several plots should be copied into one table, to later distinguish the different data columns.<br>Finally you can choose whether only the data should be added, or whether also the plot should be copied to the table. In the first case, the plot data will only be added to the table, in the second case, a new plot will be created, or an existing plot will be extended.
				 
				 $$note:The data will be copied and is NOT linked to the plot, so if the plot changes afterwards, the table RDR data stays the same!$$
      </li>
	  <li><a name="curverdr"><img src=":/libqf3widgets/qfplotter_copytocurve.png"> <b>copy graph(s) to curve RDR:</b> This function can be used to create a <a href="$$plugin_info:help:curves$$">curves raw data record</a> from the current plot. This is not possible for all graphs in the plot, only for those graphs that are based on XY-data (with errors). Especially it is not possible for image plots!<br>After clicking on this menu entry, you will be asked to select the curves to export (if there are more than one) and then a new curve RDR will be added to the project. $$note:The data will be copied and is NOT linked to the plot, so if the plot changes afterwards, the curve RDR data stays the same!$$
      </li>
	  <li><b>Save Image Plot Images ...:</b>  Allows to save the raw image of every image graph within the plot separately
	  $$startbox_example$$
If the plot (including the context-menu) looks like this:
<center><a name="faq_pic000"><img src="./pic/faq_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
Copying the right-hand sided image results in:
<center><a name="faq_pic001"><img src="./pic/faq_pic001.png" border="1">
</center>
$$endbox$$
$$note:If the image appears stretched in the plot, the axial ratio is not retained in the exported image ... the pixel axial ratio in an exported graphics is always 1 and the raw pixel data is saved!$$
$$note:This submenu is available only if image graphs are part of the plot. If there are only normal function/data raphs, these submenus are not shown.$$
</li>
      <li><b>Copy Image Plot Images ...:</b>  Allows to copy the raw image of every image graph within the plot separately (cf. Save Image Plot Images" above)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Zooming</h2>
<p>You can zoom into the graphs on several ways:
<ul>
  <li>You can draw a zoom rectangle onto the plot, by pressing the left mouse button on the first corner and then pull the rectangle to the desired size. Then you have to release the left mouse button and the plot range will change accoring to your selection</li>
  <li>You can use the mousewheel to zoom into the plot. The plot range will be expanded/reduced around the current mouse cursor position as the new plot center.</li>
</ul>
</p>
