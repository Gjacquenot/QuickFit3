	<p>This dialog allows to select a single or multiple (depends on the use-case) RDRs from a list. In some cases it is also possible to create a new RDR, by checking the radio-button "create new record" (if available). In the main part of the dialog a list with available RDRs is presented. In this list, you can select an RDR, by clicking on it with the mouse. If multiple RDRs should/can be selected, you can click them one by one, while keeping the CTRL-key pressed. It is also possible to filter this list, by entering a filter-espression in the line-edit "filter". Then only those RDRs will be displayed in the list, where the given filter text is contained in the name. You can use the wildcards '?' to match any single character and '*' to match any number of characters. For example, if the list contains the RDRs:
	<ol>
	  <li>file 1</li>
	  <li>file 2</li>
	  <li>data 1</li>
	  <li>data 2,</li>
	</ol>  
	The filter <tt>file*</tt> will reduce the list to items 1 and 2, while <tt>*1</tt> will reduce to 1 and 3.
