<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you need a C/C++ compiler on Microsoft Windows, which can be used to create plugins for QuickFit $$version$$ (e.g. for <a href="userfitfunctions_library.html">user-defined fit functions</a>), you can use the free <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a>/<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64">MinGW-W64</a> version of the <a href="http://gcc-gnu.org">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>. A project, which distributes pre-compiled packages of this compiler, together with the needed libraries is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/">MinGW-builds</a>. This is also the compiler, that is used to build the windows binary releases of QuickFit $$version$$. </p>
$$note:QuickFit is available in two flavors: a 32-bit and a 64-bit version and if you write plugins, the compiler has to produce binaries, which match the bit-depth of your QuickFit copy. The bit-depth is displayed at the bottom of the QuickFit-welcome screen/splash window, which you can view in the about-dialog (main-window, menu entry: <code>Help | About</code>). It is also listed under "QuickFit bit-depth" in the "Info"-tab of that about-dialog$$
$$note:If you need to know the exact name/version of the compiler, used to build you QuickFit version, you can look into the about-dialog (main-window, menu entry: <code>Help | About</code>). There the compiler is listed in the "Info" tab, if you scroll down to the entry "compiler used for this version:".$$

<h2>How-to install</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Find out the bit-depth of your QuickFit version (see above).</li>    
    <li>Go to the webpage <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/</a> and download the installer there.</li>
    <li>Execute the installer. select the version you want (generally >4.4 is fine, or select the version that your QuickFit was compiled with, see above). Here are two example-configurations of the installer for 32-bit and 64-bit and MinGW 4.8.1:

      </center>
    </li>
    <li>Now you have the compiler and all basic C/C++ libraries (stdlib/STL) installed. The installer created a start-menu entry, which opens a console, in which you can use the compiler:
