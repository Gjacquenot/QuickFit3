<a name="FAQ_USERFITFUNC"><b>How to define your own fit-functions?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
You can define fit functions via the internal math expression parser (simple), or via simple fit function plugins (faster). A detailed description can be found under <a href="userfitfunctions.html">user-defined fit functions</a>.

  <a name="FAQ_SAVEPLOT"><b>How to save a plot as an image/PDF/LaTeX?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  You can save most plots in QuickFit by right-clicking on the plot and then choosing <img src=":/images/jkqtp_saveplot.png"> Save Plot. A detailed description can be found under <a href="$$qf_ui_jkqtplotter_helpfile$$">$$qf_ui_jkqtplotter_helpfiletitle$$</a>.

  <a name="FAQ_PRINTPLOT"><b>How to print a plot?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  You can print most plots in QuickFit by right-clicking on the plot and then choosing <img src=":/images/jkqtp_print.png"> Print Plot. A detailed description can be found under <a href="$$qf_ui_jkqtplotter_helpfile$$">$$qf_ui_jkqtplotter_helpfiletitle$$</a>.

  <a name="FAQ_PlotTableRDR"><b>How to save a plot as an editable table-RDR in a project?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Most plots in QuickFit can be stored as a <a href="$$plugin_info:help:table$$">table raw data record</a> in the current project. QuickFit then creates a new (or appends to an existing) table RDR in the current project, adds all data columns, that are necessary for the plot to that table and creates a plot in it, which resembles the plot you want to save. This way, the plot can be altered and formatted (e.g. for a publication). ALso the data can be procesed further (fits, statistics etc.).<br>
      To copy a plot in this way,<ol>
      <li>right-click the plot</li>
      <li>choose <img src=":/libqf3widgets/qfplotter_copytotable.png"> <b>copy plot data to table RDR</b> </li>
      <li>set all properties in the following dialog as required (e.g. give a new name for the table-RDR, or select an existing one and give a new name for the plot in the table (or select an existing one).</li>
      <li>now you can edit the plot (and its data), by double-clicking the new table RDR in the project tree.</li>
      </ol><br>

  <a name="FAQ_PlotExportData"><b>How can I export the data used for a plot in QuickFit?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Most plots in QuickFit allow to access the data, which was used to generate them. You have generally several possibilities, that are all accessible in the context-menu (pops open after a right-click) of the plot:
      <ol>
        <li>choose <img src=":/images/jkqtp_savedata.png"> <b>Save Data</b>, which saves the data for the plot as a table into a file (e.g. in the CSV, Excel, Matlab, ... format). </li>
        <li>choose <img src=":/images/jkqtp_copydata.png"> <b>Copy Data</b>, which copies the data for the plot as a table into the clipboard.  </li>
        <li>choose <img src=":/images/jkqtp_copymatlab.png"> <b>Copy Data Matlab</b>, which copies the data for the plot as a Matlab script into the clipboard.  </li>
        <li>choose <img src=":/jkqtp_showplotdata.png"> <b>Show Plot Data</b>, which opens a new window, which contains the plot data as a table</li>
        <li><a href="#FAQ_PlotTableRDR">copy the plot data to a table RDR</a>, which then contains the plot data as table.</li>
      </ol><br>

  <a name="FAQ_CITE"><b>How can I cite QuickFit in my publication?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  If you use QuickFit $$version$$ for a publication, please cite the program. A detailed reference example (and BiBTeX-record) is given in <a href="citing.html">citing QuickFit $$version$$</a>.

  <a name="FAQ_FIXFILES"><b>QuickFit does not find some of the data files, when loading a project (orange warnings). What can I do?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  If the files have been moved, or the paths are scrambled in the project file (this sometimes happens), you can use the function <a href="dlgfixfilepaths.html">Tools | Project Tools | Fix Filepaths</a>:</b>

  <a name="FAQ_RENAMEGROUP"><b>How do I rename RDR groups for several RDRs?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  You can rename RDR groups, by using the menu entry <a href="dlgrenamegroups.html">Tools | Project Tools | Rename RDR groups</a>.

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_RDRPROP"><b>How can I set the name/folder/group/role/properties of several RDRs all at once?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  There are several functions, which allow this (with different feature sets):<ul>
        <li><a href="dlgsetrdrpropertybyregexp.html">Tools | Project Tools | set RDR properties with a regular expression</a></li>
        <li><a href="dlgrdrsetproperty.html">Tools | Project Tools | set property in multiple RDRs</a></li>
        <li><a href="dlgrdrreplace.html">Tools | Project Tools | find/replace in raw data record name/folder</a></li>
      </ul><br>
      <i>These functions can all be found in the main menu of QuickFit.</i>

  <a name="FAQ_SENDZIP"><b>How can send a project with the data files to a colleague?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  You can compress every project into a ZIP file, which also contains all required data files. To do so, save your project and use the function <b>File | Compress project ...</b>". This will generate a ZIP-archive, which can then be extracted. It contains a single QFP-project file, which can finally be loaded by your colleague.
$$faq_end$$


$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_QFPZ"><b>What is the difference between QFP- and QFPZ-files?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Both are project files, which store single QuickFit project. The QFP-variant is a human-readable text file (actually XML). Sometimes these files can get rather large (several MBytes). Then you can save the project as a QFPZ-file, which is the QFP-file compressed with GZip.
