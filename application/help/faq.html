<a name="FAQ_USERFITFUNC"><b>How to define your own fit-functions?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
You can define fit functions via the internal math expression parser (simple), or via simple fit function plugins (faster). A detailed description can be found under <a href="userfitfunctions.html">user-defined fit functions</a>.

  <a name="FAQ_PRINTPLOT"><b>How to print a plot?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  You can print most plots in QuickFit by right-clicking on the plot and then choosing <img src=":/images/jkqtp_print.png"> Print Plot. A detailed description can be found under <a href="$$qf_ui_jkqtplotter_helpfile$$">$$qf_ui_jkqtplotter_helpfiletitle$$</a>.

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_PlotTableRDR"><b>How to save a plot as an editable table-RDR in a project?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Most plots in QuickFit can be stored as a <a href="$$plugin_info:help:table$$">table raw data record</a> in the current project. QuickFit then creates a new (or appends to an existing) table RDR in the current project, adds all data columns, that are necessary for the plot to that table and creates a plot in it, which resembles the plot you want to save. This way, the plot can be altered and formatted (e.g. for a publication). ALso the data can be procesed further (fits, statistics etc.).<br>
      To copy a plot in this way,<ol>
      <li>right-click the plot</li>
      <li>choose <img src=":/libqf3widgets/qfplotter_copytotable.png"> <b>copy plot data to table RDR</b> </li>
      <li>set all properties in the following dialog as required (e.g. give a new name for the table-RDR, or select an existing one and give a new name for the plot in the table (or select an existing one).</li>
      <li>now you can edit the plot (and its data), by double-clicking the new table RDR in the project tree.</li>
      </ol><br>

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_PlotExportData"><b>How can I export the graph data used for a plot in QuickFit?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Most plots in QuickFit allow to access the data, which was used to generate them. You have generally several possibilities, that are all accessible in the context-menu (pops open after a right-click) of the plot:
      <ol>
        <li>choose <img src=":/images/jkqtp_savedata.png"> <b>Save Data</b>, which saves the data for the plot as a table into a file (e.g. in the CSV, Excel, Matlab, ... format). </li>
        <li>choose <img src=":/images/jkqtp_copydata.png"> <b>Copy Data</b>, which copies the data for the plot as a table into the clipboard.  </li>
        <li>choose <img src=":/images/jkqtp_copymatlab.png"> <b>Copy Data Matlab</b>, which copies the data for the plot as a Matlab script into the clipboard.  </li>
        <li>choose <img src=":/jkqtp_showplotdata.png"> <b>Show Plot Data</b>, which opens a new window, which contains the plot data as a table</li>
        <li><a href="#FAQ_PlotTableRDR">copy the plot data to a table RDR</a>, which then contains the plot data as table.</li>

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_Matlab"><b>How can I export data to Matlab(r)?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Generally you can use the context-menus to export the data of any plot (right-click the plot and choose <b>Save Data</b> or <b>Show Plot Data</b> and save from the table that opens up)
  <center><a name="faq_pic002"><img src="./pic/faq_pic002.png" border="1">
  </center>
  and of any data table (select the data to export, right-click and choose <b>Save Selection | Save Selection</b>, or any of the other <i>Save Data</i> options).
  <center><a name="faq_pic003"><img src="./pic/faq_pic003.png" border="1">
  </center>
  Then you can choose different file formats to save to. 
  <center><a name="faq_pic004"><img src="./pic/faq_pic004.png" border="1">
  </center>
  Among these there are several options for Matlab:
  <ul>
      <li><b>Matlab MAT files (*.mat)</b> stores the data as a (binary) MAT-file that can be loaded in Matlab or GNU Octave using the instruction <center><tt>load('<i>filename</i>', '-v6')</tt></center>The options "as Cell/Matrix" try to save the data as a double-matrix, but if this does not succeed (e.g. because the table also contains text), data is stored as a cell array. This retains all data in the table. The options "as Matrix" convert data to a number-matrix and remove any text or other data that cannot be exported. Such cells will be saved as <tt>NAN</tt> (not a number).</li>
      <li><b>Matlab script (*.m)</b> save a Matlab script that contains the single definition of a matrix/cell array with the data in plain text format. This is a simplified option, also used when "copy data to Matlab" is choosen from the table context menu.</li>
  </ul>

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_PlotExportImage"><b>How can I get the image data (without axes etc.) from a plot in QuickFit as an image, or copy them to the clipboard?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Most plots in QuickFit allow to save the images, that they contain as pixel imagefiles (e.g. PNG/JPEG/BMP/...). Simply right-click on a plot. At the bottom of the context-menu, two submenus <b>"Save Image Plot Images ..."</b> and <b>"Copy Image Plot Images ..."</b> are visible. They contain entries for every saveable/copyable image within the plot.
$$startbox_example$$
If the plot (including the context-menu) looks like this:
<center><a name="faq_pic000"><img src="./pic/faq_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
Copying the right-hand sided image results in:
<center><a name="faq_pic001"><img src="./pic/faq_pic001.png" border="1">
</center>
$$endbox$$

$$note:If the image appears stretched in the plot, the axial ratio is not retained in the exported image ... the pixel axial ratio in an exported graphics is always 1 and the raw pixel data is saved!$$
If you want to get the full plot (including axes etc.) as an image, you can still use the normal context-emnu entries <img src=":/images/jkqtp_saveplot.png"> <b>Save Plot</b> and <img src=":/images/jkqtp_print.png"> <b>Print Plot</b>.

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_FIXFILES"><b>QuickFit does not find some of the data files, when loading a project (orange warnings). What can I do?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  If the files have been moved, or the paths are scrambled in the project file (this sometimes happens), you can use the function <a href="dlgfixfilepaths.html">Tools | Project Tools | Fix Filepaths</a>:</b>
$$faq_end$$




$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_RENAMEGROUP"><b>How do I rename RDR groups for several RDRs?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  You can rename RDR groups, by using the menu entry <a href="dlgrenamegroups.html">Tools | Project Tools | Rename RDR groups</a>.
$$faq_end$$




$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_RDRPROP"><b>How can I set the name/folder/group/role/properties of several RDRs all at once?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  There are several functions, which allow this (with different feature sets):<ul>
        <li><a href="dlgsetrdrpropertybyregexp.html">Tools | Project Tools | set RDR properties with a regular expression</a></li>
        <li><a href="dlgrdrsetproperty.html">Tools | Project Tools | set property in multiple RDRs</a></li>
        <li><a href="dlgrdrreplace.html">Tools | Project Tools | find/replace in raw data record name/folder</a></li>
      </ul><br>
      <i>These functions can all be found in the main menu of QuickFit.</i>

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_SENDZIP"><b>How can send a project with the data files to a colleague?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  You can compress every project into a ZIP file, which also contains all required data files. To do so, save your project and use the function <b>File | Compress project ...</b>". This will generate a ZIP-archive, which can then be extracted. It contains a single QFP-project file, which can finally be loaded by your colleague.
$$faq_end$$


$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_QFPZ"><b>What is the difference between QFP- and QFPZ-files?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Both are project files, which store single QuickFit project. The QFP-variant is a human-readable text file (actually XML). Sometimes these files can get rather large (several MBytes). Then you can save the project as a QFPZ-file, which is the QFP-file compressed with GZip.

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_ANNOYASKSAVE"><b>How can I get rid of that annoying question, whether to save the project after I added the first evaluation/RDR object?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  You can switch this behaviour off (although this is not recommended) in the program settings, which you can find under <b>File | Preferences ...</b> in the mainwindow. In this dialog you can find that option under the group <b>Autosave</b> as a checkbox <b>ask user to save project after first edit</b>.

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_ANNOYWELCOME"><b>How can I get rid of that annoying welcome screen?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  You can switch this behaviour off (although this is not recommended) in the program settings, which you can find under <b>File | Preferences ...</b> in the mainwindow. In this dialog you can find that option under the group <b>View, Language, General Settings</b> as a checkbox <b>welcome screen: show on startup</b>.

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_RENAMEGROUP"><b>On Windows: When I use a file open dialog and navigate into a folder with large TIFF files with many frames, QuickFit afterwards uses a lot of processing power and memory. What can I do?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  This behaviour seems to be connected to the Windows Explorer, which is used by Windows, when the OS-specific File-Open/File-Save/... dialogs are used. The explorer seems to try and read the TIFF-file and generate a preview from it. Usually you will notice this also in a "normal" explorer, when you navigate to that directory and the file dates appear only after seconds or minutes (or never for that matter). No solution is known to generally solve this explorer problem, but you can tell QuickFit to use its own File-Open dialogs, which do not have that problem. To do so, got to the settings dialog under the menu <b>File | Preferences ...</b> in the mainwindow. There you can change the type of file dialogs that QuickFit uses under <b>View, Language, General Settings</b>. Change the option <b>file dialogs</b> to <b>QuickFit 3/Qt specific dialogs</b>.

  <a name="FAQ_MACNUMBERWHEEL"><b>On MacOS X: By tuching a MightyMouse the values in a number-edit are altered. What can I do?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  This is a problem of the mighty mouse with its touch-pad on the top, which is used as a mouse-wheel. To overcome this problem, it is possible to cause some of the number widgets (e.g. for the FCS fit parameters) to not react to mouse-wheel actions. This can be set in <b>File | Preferences ...</b> and the <b>View, Language, General Settings</b> with the checkbox <b>MacOS X: sub-window menus: use sub-window menus (e.g. RDR editor) as main menu (unchecked: menus are shown in window!)</b>.
$$faq_end$$


$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_MACMENUS"><b>On MacOS X: Can I prevent/ensure that the menus of sub-windows are used as main-menu (at the top of the screen)?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  This can be set in <b>File | Preferences ...</b> and the <b>View, Language, General Settings</b> with the checkbox <b>number-edit widgtes: allow mouse-wheel scrolling to increase/decrease value</b>.

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_TOOMANYWINDOWS"><b>I opened several sub-windows. Now I can't find one of them. What can I do?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  In the main window, click on the menu entry <b>View | raise opened windows ...</b>, which opens a list of all opened windows. If you click on any of the menu entries that window will be raised on the desktop and shown.

$$faq_start$$
  <a name="FAQ_WRONGTEMP"><b>QuickFit repeatedly tries to create temporary files (and fails) in a strange directory. Can I tell QUickFit to use a different temporary directory?</b>
$$faq_answer$$
  Yes, you can override the system default for a temporary directory by opening the settings dialog (<b>File | Preferences ...</b> in the mainwindow). In this dialog you can find that option under the group <b>Directories</b>, where you first have to actiavte the checkbox to override the system default and then have to give an appropriate directory, where QUickFit will get write access.
  $$warning:If QuickFit cannot gain qrite-access to this directory, several functions withing QuickFit may fail and you may experience data-loss. THerefore it is not adviced to change the temporary directory unless really necessary. Also note that QuickFit will extensively use this directory, but will also try and clean-up all temporary files when it closes.$$
