<a name="#overview"><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This page describes the basic features any evaluation screen implements. 
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_eval.png"></center>
The screen shows at least three tabs at the top. Which are described in the next sections.
The button <b><img src=":/help.png"> Help</b> may be used to display this online help message.
</p>

<a name="#props"><h2>Properties</h2>
<p>
The first tab <b>Properties</b> (see image above) may be used to enter a name for the evaluation (which will also appear in the project tree) and a describing text. In the description you may e.g. note why you chose this evaluation, or what you've exactly done to your data.<br> In addition the internal unique ID (an integer number) of the evaluation is displayed and a desciption of the evaluation type. 
</p> 
<a name="#eval"><h2>Evaluation Tabs</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of your plugin you will see different evaluation tabs (there could be even more than one). THese are completely plugin-dependent. The only common feature is a sometimes present list of all records that this plugin can be used with on the right-hand side. Below this list you will find a button that allows to delete the currently displayed record. In some plugins you can also select different records in this list, that will be used by the evaluation. It is (for some plugins) also possible to filter this list using wildcard strings or regular expressions. See below (<a href="#filertable">filtering the table</a>) for more details on the possible filter expressions) Finally note that this list will only contain those raw data records that can be evaluated with the selected plugin, so there may be less records than in the project.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 

<a name="#evalresults"><h2>Evaluation Results</h2>
<h3>Basic Features</h3>
<p> The second last tab <b>Evaluation Results</b> may be used to view the results of the evaluation object. These results (but only for one raw data record) are also visible on the <a href="qf3_rdrscreen.html">raw data record screen</a>.
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_eval_results.png"></center>
<ul>
<li>The results are shown as a table, where every row represents the set of results for ONE raw data record. Every row is designated by the evaluation result id, which consists of the raw data record name (e.g. <tt>20nM_488_Day2_04s.asc - CH0</tt>), the evaluation type name together with the internal ID of the evaluation object (e.g. <tt>fcs_fit_1</tt> where <tt>1</tt> is the ID) and an evaluation-dependend suffix (e.g. <tt>fcd_diff1_run0</tt>) . Every column shows the single results (if they are numbers or strings).</li>
<li>average and standard deviation over the currently selected cells will be displayed as a second table below the results table.</li>
<li>If a cell contains not a single value or value/error pair it might not be possible to display it in a concise form. Usually vectors/matrices are only displayed directly, if they contain less than 10 elements. If there are more items only the data type name is displayed to save space. If the mouse hovers of a vector/matrix field, the average value and standard deviation of the numbers in the list (if applicable) is shown as a tooltip.</li>
<li><img src=":/lib/refresh16.png"> reloads the results. This may be necessary, when new fit results were produced, but the table was not yet updated with them.</li>
<li><img src=":/lib/delete16.png"> deletes the selected results. You can also click on the top-left corner of the table, which will select all results and then click on <img src=":/lib/delete16.png">. This will delete all results from the current evaluation in the current project.</li>
<li>Many functions are also accessible over the windows main menu and the tables <b>context menu</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Filtering results/Change displayed rows&amp;columns</h3>
<p>The results table can be filtered and modified interactively:<ul>
  <li><a name="#filertable"><a name="filertable"> The <b>filename filter</b> allows to interactively filter the rows in the table: If this is non-empty, only rows that match (match means "contains", wildcards * for many characters and ? for a single character are possible) the filter string are displayed. If "RegExp" is activated you may use full <a href="qf3_qtregexp.html">regular expressions</a> instead of the simple wildcards.</li>
  <li>The <b>results filter</b> allows to filter the columns, the same way as the filename filter filters the rows. If "RegExp" is activated you may use full <a href="qf3_qtregexp.html">regular expressions</a> instead of the simple wildcards.</li>
  <li>You can display any RDR property as an additional row in the table, by adding the property name to the "<b>display roles</b>" field. You can separate several properties by commas.</li>
  <li>Results may also be in vector or matrix form. For these two display modes are available, which may be changed with the checkbox "<b>show avg+/-SD for vector/matrix results</b>": If it is activated, the average and standard deviation over the full vector/matrix is displayed (in blue and italic). Also the datatype is named in the second line in each cell. If this option is deactivated, only the type name is displayed if more than 10 entries are present. Otherwise the entries are displayed as a list. If in addition "<b>mind excluded runs for in-cell statistics</b>" is checked, and the result is for a RDR with a mask, the masked runs are not included in the statistics.</li>
  <li>The checkbox <b>show runs/indices</b> allows to add an additional column (at the start of the table), which contains the run/index of the current row of fit results (if applicable). The value -1 is displayed, if no run could be extracted from the row of values (i.e. the result set).<br>If in addition <b>don't show removed runs</b> is checked, all those rows/results are removed from the table, where the according run is removed/masked from the record.</li>
</ul></p>


<h3>Export/Print/Copy data</h3>
<p>Most of these functions are found in the context menu of the table. Some are also accessible with buttons above the table. These functions <u>always apply to all cells</u>:
<ul>
  <li> <img src=":/lib/print.png"> <b>Print Table</b> prints the current table</li>
  <li> context-menu: <img src=":/lib/copy16.png"> <b>Copy table as image</b> copies the table as a pixel image/bitmap into the clipboard. You can then paste the table into any image or text processing software.</li>
  <li><img src=":/lib/save16.png"> <b>save all results as file</b> stores the complete table as a data file (e.g. CSV, Excel, Matlab, ...). If any result is a vector or matrix (displayed as a single cell in the table), it is expanded in the file.</li>
  <li><b>Save all results to file, averaged vector/matrix results</b> stores the complete table as a data file (e.g. CSV, Excel, Matlab, ...). If any result is a vector or matrix (displayed as a single cell in the table), only the average and standard dveiation are stored in the file.</li>
</ul>
The following functions apply only to the <u>currently selected cells</u> in the table. If you want to save/copy all cells, you have to select them by clicking on the top-left corner of the table. They are also mostly found in the context menu:
<ul>
    <li><img src=":/lib/copy16valerr.png"> <b>Copy Selection as value+error pairs</b> copies the selected cells as a table into the clipboard. If a result contains an error, two columns are copied and if it is a vector/matrix, the average and standard deciation are calculated.</li>
    <li><img src=":/lib/copy16valerr_nohead.png"> <b>Copy Selection as value+error pairs, w/o header</b> copies the selected cells as a table into the clipboard. If a result contains an error, two columns are copied and if it is a vector/matrix, the average and standard deciation are calculated. This instruction omits the column/row headers, i.e. copies the data only. </li>
    <li><img src=":/lib/copy16valerr.png"> <b>Copy Selection as median+q25+q75</b>  copies the selected cells as a table into the clipboard. If a result is a vector/matrix, the median, the 25% and the 75% quantile are calculated.</li>
    <li><img src=":/lib/copy16valerr_nohead.png"> <b>Copy Selection as median+q25+q75, w/o header</b>  copies the selected cells as a table into the clipboard. If a result is a vector/matrix, the median, the 25% and the 75% quantile are calculated.  This instruction omits the column/row headers, i.e. copies the data only.</li>
    <li><img src=":/lib/copy16.png"> <b>copy in expanded form</b> The functions in this sub-menu expand vector/matrix results to several columns in the copied output<ul>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form</b> copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form (see box at the end of this section!)</li>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form, flipped</b> copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form and rotates the table </li>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form, w/o header</b> copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form, but without row/column headers </li>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form, w/o header, flipped</b> copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form, but without row/column headers and rotates the table </li>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form, to Matlab</b>  copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form into a Matlab script</li>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form, to Matlab, flipped</b> copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form into a Matlab script </li>
    </ul></li>

$$see:See also the help page on <a href="qf3_fileformats.html">Common Fileformats in QuickFit</a> for informations on some of the different available export formats.$$
$$startbox_info$$
<b>Expanded/Non-Expanded Form</b><br>
The expanded form is a special form of data export, where a cell, which contains multiple values (e.g. because it contains an error for the parameter, or it contains a vector or matrix) is expanded into several columns (or rows in a flipped/rotated table). the following images show the input and output of such an operation in "expanded form":
<center>
<b>Input with parameter error:</b> 
<a name="qf3_evalscreen_pic001"><img src="./pic/qf3_evalscreen_pic001.png" border="1">
<br><b>Output "expanded form":</b>
<img src="./pic/qf3_evalscreen_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
The same, as above for a cell, containing a matrix
<center><b>Input with parameter matrix:</b> 
<a name="qf3_evalscreen_pic002"><img src="./pic/qf3_evalscreen_pic002.png" border="1">
<br><b>Output "expanded form":</b>
<a name="qf3_evalscreen_pic003"><img src="./pic/qf3_evalscreen_pic003.png" border="1">
</center>

$$endbox$$
</p>

<h3>Result statistics/Plots</h3>
<p>You may view the contents of selected cells as histogram using these functions:<ol>
  <li><img src=":/lib/result_statistics.png"> <b>histogram: column-wise</b> opens a <a href="qfhistogram.html">histogram window</a> that summarizes all selected values (vectors/matrizes are linearized) for each result into one histogram. So if you select the diffusion coefficients of species 1 and 2 from several runs, the window will contain two histograms, one for D1 and one for D2 overlayed. If you select data from several results (e.g. D1 and D2), QuickFit will ask whether to display all histograms in one window or to open one window per result.<br>Look at this example:  
  <center><img src="./pic/hist_eval.png"></center><br>
  This function will open one or two windows containing the histograms over each column. here's an example for one window (in the two-window case, the green and blue histograms will be displayed in one window each):
  <center><img src="./pic/hist_eval_res_no.png"></center>
   </li>
  <li><img src=":/lib/result_statistics_compare.png"> <b>histogram: cells-wise</b> works the same as above, but does not summarize the data from several runs. This is useful, if you get vectors/matrizes as results, where you want to compare the distributions in each of them. If you select single-number results, no histogram will be displayed, as it makes not much sense for one datapoint only.</li>
