<a name="#overview"><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This page describes the basic features any evaluation screen implements. 
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_eval.png"></center>
The screen shows at least three tabs at the top. Which are described in the next sections.
The button <b><img src=":/help.png"> Help</b> may be used to display this online help message.
</p>

<a name="#props"><h2>Properties</h2>
<p>
The first tab <b>Properties</b> (see image above) may be used to enter a name for the evaluation (which will also appear in the project tree) and a describing text. In the description you may e.g. note why you chose this evaluation, or what you've exactly done to your data.<br> In addition the internal unique ID (an integer number) of the evaluation is displayed and a desciption of the evaluation type. 
</p> 
<a name="#eval"><h2>Evaluation Tabs</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of your plugin you will see different evaluation tabs (there could be even more than one). THese are completely plugin-dependent. The only common feature is a sometimes present list of all records that this plugin can be used with on the right-hand side. Below this list you will find a button that allows to delete the currently displayed record. In some plugins you can also select different records in this list, that will be used by the evaluation. Finally note that this list will only contain those raw data records that can be evaluated with the selected plugin, so there may be less records than in the project.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<a name="#evalresults"><h2>Evaluation Results</h2>
<p> The second last tab <b>Evaluation Results</b> may be used to view the results of the evaluation object. These results (but only for one raw data record) are also visible on the <a href="qf3_rdrscreen.html">raw data record screen</a>.
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_eval_results.png"></center>
This tab has some features:
<ul>
<li>The results are shown as a table, where every row represents the set of results for ONE raw data record. Every row is designated by the evaluation result id, which consists of the raw data record name (e.g. <tt>20nM_488_Day2_04s.asc - CH0</tt>), the evaluation type name together with the internal ID of the evaluation object (e.g. <tt>fcs_fit_1</tt> where <tt>1</tt> is the ID) and an evaluation-dependend suffix (e.g. <tt>fcd_diff1_run0</tt>) . Every column shows the single results (if they are numbers or strings).</li>
<li>average and standard deviation over the currently selected cells will be sidplayed as a second table below the results table.</li>
<li>If a cell contains not a single value or value/error pair it might not be possible to display it in a concise form. Usually vectors/matrices are only displayed directly, if they contain less than 10 elements. If there are more items only the data type name is displayed to save space. If the mouse hovers of a vector/matrix field, the average value and standard deviation of the numbers in the list (if applicable) is shown as a tooltip.</li>

<li>You may select multiple cells in the results table and then <b>copy them to the system clipboard</b>, using the <img src=":/lib/copy16.png"> button. The clipboard contents may be directly pasted into a text editor or a spreadsheet program (e.g. OpenOffice Calc, or Microsoft Excel). The button <img src=":/lib/copy16_nohead.png"> will copy the data only (no header rows/columns). Using the button <img src=":/lib/copy16valerr.png"> instead will also copy the selection, but values and errors are separated into two subsequent columns. This option also copies average and standard deviation of a number list/matrix as value/error.</li>
<li>You may also <b>save the complete table</b>> of results to a data file which is readable by most spreadsheet programs, using the <img src=":/lib/save16.png"> button. </li>
<li>A click on <img src=":/lib/refresh16.png"> will reload the results.</li>
</ul>
