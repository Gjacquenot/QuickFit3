<a name="#overview"><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This page describes the basic features any evaluation screen implements. 
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_eval.png"></center>
The screen shows at least three tabs at the top. Which are described in the next sections.
The button <b><img src=":/help.png"> Help</b> may be used to display this online help message.
</p>

<a name="#props"><h2>Properties</h2>
<p>
The first tab <b>Properties</b> (see image above) may be used to enter a name for the evaluation (which will also appear in the project tree) and a describing text. In the description you may e.g. note why you chose this evaluation, or what you've exactly done to your data.<br> In addition the internal unique ID (an integer number) of the evaluation is displayed and a desciption of the evaluation type. 
</p> 
<a name="#eval"><h2>Evaluation Tabs</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of your plugin you will see different evaluation tabs (there could be even more than one). THese are completely plugin-dependent. The only common feature is a sometimes present list of all records that this plugin can be used with on the right-hand side. Below this list you will find a button that allows to delete the currently displayed record. In some plugins you can also select different records in this list, that will be used by the evaluation. It is (for some plugins) also possible to filter this list using wildcard strings or regular expressions. See below (<a href="#filertable">filtering the table</a>) for more details on the possible filter expressions) Finally note that this list will only contain those raw data records that can be evaluated with the selected plugin, so there may be less records than in the project.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<a name="#evalresults"><h2>Evaluation Results</h2>
<p> The second last tab <b>Evaluation Results</b> may be used to view the results of the evaluation object. These results (but only for one raw data record) are also visible on the <a href="qf3_rdrscreen.html">raw data record screen</a>.
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_eval_results.png"></center>
This tab has these features:
<ul>
<li>The results are shown as a table, where every row represents the set of results for ONE raw data record. Every row is designated by the evaluation result id, which consists of the raw data record name (e.g. <tt>20nM_488_Day2_04s.asc - CH0</tt>), the evaluation type name together with the internal ID of the evaluation object (e.g. <tt>fcs_fit_1</tt> where <tt>1</tt> is the ID) and an evaluation-dependend suffix (e.g. <tt>fcd_diff1_run0</tt>) . Every column shows the single results (if they are numbers or strings).</li>
<li>average and standard deviation over the currently selected cells will be sidplayed as a second table below the results table.</li>
<li>If a cell contains not a single value or value/error pair it might not be possible to display it in a concise form. Usually vectors/matrices are only displayed directly, if they contain less than 10 elements. If there are more items only the data type name is displayed to save space. If the mouse hovers of a vector/matrix field, the average value and standard deviation of the numbers in the list (if applicable) is shown as a tooltip.</li>

<li>You may select multiple cells in the results table and then <b>copy them to the system clipboard</b>, using the <img src=":/lib/copy16.png"> button. The clipboard contents may be directly pasted into a text editor or a spreadsheet program (e.g. OpenOffice Calc, or Microsoft Excel). The button <img src=":/lib/copy16_nohead.png"> will copy the data only (no header rows/columns). Using the button <img src=":/lib/copy16valerr.png"> instead will also copy the selection, but values and errors are separated into two subsequent columns. This option also copies average and standard deviation of a number list/matrix as value/error. There are additional options to no copy average+s.d., but rather media + 25% quantile + 75% quantile. Using <img src=":/lib/copy16_matlab.png"> will copy the selection as Matlab script.</li>
<li> Using <img src=":/lib/print.png"> it is possible to print the current table</li>

<li>You may also <b>save the complete table</b>> of results to a data file which is readable by most spreadsheet programs, using the <img src=":/lib/save16.png"> button. If there are vector/matrix results (displayed as only one table cell) this function will store each item of the result as a separated column in the file. If you don't need this functionality there is a second variety of this command in the "Results" menu, wwhich stores the average of the vector/matrix result (and possibly the average of it's error). See also the help page on <a href="qf3_fileformats.html">Common Fileformats in QuickFit</a>.</li>
<li>A click on <img src=":/lib/refresh16.png"> will reload the results.</li>
<li>A click on <img src=":/lib/delete16.png"> will delete the selected results.</li>
<li><a name="#filertable"/><a name="filertable"/>The <b>filename filer</b> allows to interactively filter the results table: If this is non-empty, only rows that match (match means "contains", wildcards * for many characters and ? for a single character are possible) the filter string are displayed. If "RegExp" is activated you may use full <a href="qf3_qtregexp.html">regular expressions</a> instead of the simple wildcards.</li>
<li>The <b>results filer</b> allows to filter the columns, the same way as the filename filter filters the rows. If "RegExp" is activated you may use full <a href="qf3_qtregexp.html">regular expressions</a> instead of the simple wildcards.</li>
<li>All functions are also accessible over the windows main menu and the tables context menu.</li>
<li>Results may also be in vector or matrix form. For these two display modes are available, which may be changed with the checkbox "show avg+/-SD for vector/matrix results": If it is activated, the average and standard deviation over the full vector/matrix is displayed (in blue and italic). Also the datatype is named in the second line in each cell. If this option is deactivated, only the type name is displayed if more than 10 entries are present. Otherwise the entries are displayed as a list. </li>
<li>You may view the contents of selected cells as histogram using these functions:<ol>
  <li><img src=":/lib/result_statistics.png"> opens a histogram window that summarizes all selected values (vectors/matrizes are linearized) for each result into one histogram. So if you select the diffusion coefficients of species 1 and 2 from several runs, the window will contain two histograms, one for D1 and one for D2 overlayed. If you select data from several results (e.g. D1 and D2), QuickFit will ask whether to display all histograms in one window or to open one window per result.<br>Look at this example:<br>
  <img src="./pic/hist_eval.png"><br>
  This function will open one or two windows containing the histograms over each column. here's an example for one window (in the two-window case, the green and blue histograms will be displayed in one window each):<br>
  <img src="./pic/hist_eval_res_no.png">
   </li>
  <li><img src=":/lib/result_statistics_compare.png"> works the same as above, but does not summarize the data from several runs. This is useful, if you get vectors/matrizes as results, where you want to compare the distributions in each of them. If you select single-number results, no histogram will be displayed, as it makes not much sense for one datapoint only.</li>
</ol>
