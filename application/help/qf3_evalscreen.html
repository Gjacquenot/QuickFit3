<h2>QuickFit $$version$$ evaluation screen</h2>
<p>
This page describes the basic features any evaluation screen implements. 
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_eval.png"></center>
The screen shows at least four tabs at the top. The last tab <b><img src=":/help.png"> Online-Help</b> may be used to display this online help message. The first tab <b>Properties</b> (see image above) may be used to enter a name for the evaluation (which will also appear in the project tree) and a describing text. In the description you may e.g. note why you chose this evaluation, or what you've exactly done to your data.<br> In addition the internal unique ID (an integer number) of the evaluation is displayed and a desciption of the evaluation type. 
</p> 
<p> The second last tab <b>Evaluation Results</b> may be used to view the results of the evaluation object. These results (but only for one raw data record) are also visible on the <a href="qf3_rdrscreen.html">raw data record screen</a>.
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_eval_results.png"></center>
This tab has some features:
<ul>
<li>The results are shown as a table, where every row represents the set of results for ONE raw data record. Every row is designated by the evaluation result id, which consists of the raw data record name (e.g. <tt>20nM_488_Day2_04s.asc - CH0</tt>), the evaluation type name together with the internal ID of the evaluation object (e.g. <tt>fcs_fit_1</tt> where <tt>1</tt> is the ID) and an evaluation-dependend suffix (e.g. <tt>fcd_diff1_run0</tt>) . Every column shows the single results (if they are numbers or strings).</li>
<li>average and standard deviation over the currently selected cells will be sidplayed as a second table below the results table.</li>
<li>You may select multiple cells in the results table and then <b>copy them to the system clipboard</b>, using the <img src=":/lib/copy16.png"> button. The clipboard contents may be directly pasted into a text editor or a spreadsheet program (e.g. OpenOffice Calc, or Microsoft Excel).</li>
<li>You may also <b>save the complete table</b>> of results to a data file which is readable by most spreadsheet programs, using the <img src=":/lib/save16.png"> button. </li>
<li>A click on <img src=":/lib/refresh16.png"> will reload the results.</li>
</ul>
