QuickFit $$version$$ uses fit functions of the form $$math:f(x;\vec{p})$$ at several places (running variable $$math:x$$ and parameter vector $$math:\vec{p}$$. The parameters are optimized in a fit, to best describe a given dataset $$math:(x_i,f_i)_{i=1,...,N}$$, i.e. typically by minimizing the sum of squared deviations: $$math:\chi^2(\vec{p})=\sum_i\left[f_i-f(x_i,\vec{p})\right]^2$$. Most commonly in data evaluation plugins, such as <a href="$$plugin_info:help:fcs_fit$$">FCS fitting</a>. 
QuickFit $$version$$ comes with a wide assortment of fit functions. These are typically implemented as QuickFit plugins and cover a wide range of applications. Still, in some cases the user might want to implement his/her own fit functions. In addition to writing a full QuickFit plugin, two simpler ways are provided:
<ol>
    <li><b><a href="userfitfunctions_parsed.html">User-defined fit-functions, using the internal expression parser</a>:</b> This is the simplest option, as you can simply type in your fit function and then use it. The draw-back is, that the fit functions are not compiled, but are parsed and evaluated during run-time (i.e. QuickFit reads your expression and interprets the text as an equation. then it inserts numbers and calculates the result), which is relatively slow, compared to fit functions implemented in QuickFit plugins, i.e. in plain C/C++.</li>    
    <li><b><a href="userfitfunctions_library.html">User-defined fit-functions, in a shared library</a>:</b> This is an advanced option, which allows you to implement your fit function in plain C/C++ and compile it into a shared library, which QuickFit imports as a light-weight plugin. The achievable speed is mostly the same as QuickFit's internal fit functions and this way you can make use of </li>
