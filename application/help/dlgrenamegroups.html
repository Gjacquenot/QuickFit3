	<h2>Rename Groups Dialog</h2>
	<p>Each raw data record has a <a href="qf3_rdrscreen.html#group">group</a>, which allows to e.g. group measurenments that belong together. In some cases the automatically created group names are rather complicated and renaming the group in each RDR separately is very time-consuming. The menu entry $$bqtt:Tools | project tools | rename RDR groups$$ opens a dialog in which all groups in the project are displayed in a table. The user can change the name of each group in this table. A click on OK applies the renames to the project.
