    <h2>Set RDR property by Regular Expression Dialog</h2>
    <p>In many cases it is desireable to set the raw data records properties (name, filder, group, ...) from other data available in the RDR. The menu entry $$bqtt:Tools | project tools | set RDR property by RegExp$$ opens a dialog, which allows to set some RDR properties using a <a href="qf3_qtregexp.html">regular expression</a>.
    <ol>
      <li>First select the RDRs in which to set properties</li>
      <li>select the property, which is matched agains the regular expression (RegExp).</li>
      <li>set the regular expression</li>
      <li>select the property to set. This is the property that is replaced by the "output string", if the regular expression mathces. For different matching/replace modes, see the next property. If you select <tt>RDR property</tt>, a new RDR property will be created with the name given in the input field property name. In that field you can drop down a list of all currently defined properties in the project, or enter a custom name. If the property already exists, it is overwritten, if not, it is created. the property will always be visible to and editable by the user! The datatype of the property can be set below its name.</li>
      <li>With <i>mode</i> you can choose how to use the RegExp:<ul>
        <li>"use output string, when matches": set the output property to the "output string", when the regular expression matches the input property</li>
        <li>"use output string, when mismatches": set the output property to the "output string", when the regular expression does not matchthe input property</li>
        <li>"use match": set the output property to the matching part of the input property</li>
        <li>"use capture 1"...: set the output property to the capture part of the RegExp in the input property (you can set matches with parantheses in the regular expression)</li>
        <li>"replace %0, %1, ... in output string by captures": set the output property to the output string, but replace in the output string every occurence of %0 by the complete match, %1 by the first capture, 52 by the second capture, ... </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li></li>
    </ol>
    $$note:There are some additional replaces in the output string: The strings %name%, %group%, %id%, %role% are ALWAYS replaced by the according information from the raw data record!$$
