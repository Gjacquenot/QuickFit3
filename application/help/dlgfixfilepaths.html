	<h2>Fix Filepaths Dialog</h2>
	<p>QuickFit saves all files with a <u>relative</u> path to the project files. Sometimes the filepaths in a project are wrong (e.g. for some reason an absolute filepath has been saved, but the project was copied to another computer with a different directory structure). In such a case, open the project (typically you will get warning in the project log, when a file could not be found) and then click the menu entry $$bqtt:Tools|project tools|fix filepaths in project.$$ 
	This will scan the whole project for files that can not be found. If such a file is found, the user is asked to locate that file. For the next file, the function will also search for the file in all directories, the user has already selected before. So typically you will have to point QuickFit to a directory one a few times, but many file links will be corrected. $$not:After running this function, please save and reload the project (file menu), so the changes take effect!$$
