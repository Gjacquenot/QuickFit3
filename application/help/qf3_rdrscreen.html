$$qf_commondoc_header.start$$ $$qf_commondoc_header.end$$ 

<a name="#ui"><h2>Basic User Interface</h2>
<h3>Window</h3>
<p>
This page describes the basic features any raw data record screen implements. 
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_rdr.png"></center>
The screen shows at least three tabs at the top. The button <b><img src=":/help.png"> Help</b> may be used to display this online help message. </p>
<p>In the head-line of this dialog you will find two buttons <img src="./pic/btn_rdr_next.png"> and <img src="./pic/btn_rdr_prev.png"> that allow to move to the next and previous record of the same type. The button <img src="./pic/btn_rdr_removerec.png"> allows to delete the current record from the project. Between the buttons QuickFit displays an icon representing the type of the current record and also its name.</p>

<a name="#menu"><h3>Menus/Buttons</h3>
<p>Several menu entries (and buttons) are available for all plugins. These menus may be extended by plugins. Then the documentation of these functions can be found in the Plugin documentation!
<ul>
  <li><u><b>Buttons:</b></u><ul>
    <li><img src="./pic/btn_rdr_prev.png">: move to previous RDR</li>
    <li><img src="./pic/btn_rdr_next.png">: move to next RDR</li>
    <li><img src="./pic/qf3_rdrscreen_pic000.png" border="1">: move to next RDR, which has the same role as the current RDR</li>
    <li><img src="./pic/btn_rdr_removerec.png">: remove the current RDR from the project</li>
    <li><b><img src=":/help.png"> Help</b>: open the online-help for the plugin</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><u><b>Menus:</b></u><ul>

<!--      <li> <b></b>: </li>-->
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>Help</b><ul>
          <li>allows to display several different online-help pages</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
</p>






<a name="#properties"><h2>Properties</h2>
<p>The first tab <b>Properties</b> (see image above) may be used to enter these:
<ul>
<li>the <em>internal unique ID</em> (an integer number) of the raw data record</li>
<li>a <a name="#description"><em>desciption of the evaluation type</em> </li>
<li>a <a name="#name"><em>name</em> for the raw data record (which will also appear in the project tree)</li>
<li>a <a name="#group"><em>group</em> to which the RDR belongs, Select "--- new group ---" to create a new group. A dialog will pop up into which the name for the new group is entered.</li>
<li>a <a name="#role"><em>role</em>: Each RDR may have a certain role within the project. this can e.g. be used to specify whether an FCS correlation record represents an ACF or a CCF</li>
<li>a <a name="#description"><em>description text</em>. In the description you may e.g. note how the data was taken, which experiment you did, which instruments you used, ...</li>
<li>a <a name="#path"><em>path</em> (with slash '<tt>/</tt>' as separator), which is used to group the records in the project tree. Simply enter a path like "<tt>mypath/subfolder</tt>" and the record will be inside the folders <tt>mypath</tt> and the <tt>subfolder</tt> below the raw data record nodes.</li>
<li>a <em>list of all files</em> associated with the record. Although these files are shown with their absolute path, only relative pathes are saved in the project where possible (e.g. when the files are on the same drive as the project file on a windows system).</li>
<li>a list of <em>properties</em>. A property is key/name (string) together with an arbitrary value (string, integer,floating-point number, boolean) that may e.g. be used to describe some additional information about the record, or the ambient conditions of the experiment, or any metadata, you like. These values are readable by evaluations. You may add a new property using the <img src=":/lib/prop_add.png"> button to add a new property and <img src=":/lib/prop_delete.png"> to remove the selected proeprty. You may edit the property value directly in the table, but note that some properties may be system-properties and are not editable. Any property you added by hand is editable in any case. To start editing of the parameter name, type or value, double-click into a table cell. <br><small>It is also possible to make a non-editable property editable, using the properties context menu. But note that this changed property may be overwritten when the project is loaded again, as read-only properties are often used to display data read from input files!</small></li>
</ul>
</p> 
<p> </p>









<a name="#results"><h2>Evaluation Results</h2>
<p>The second last tab <b>Evaluation Results</b> may be used to view the results of all evaluation objects that were used together with the current raw data record. These results (but only for one evaluation item) are also visible on the <a href="qf3_evalscreen.html">evaluation screen</a>.
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_rdr_results.png"></center>
      
<ul>
<li>The results are shown as a table, where every row represents the set of results for ONE raw data record. Every row is designated by the evaluation result id, which consists of the raw data record name (e.g. <tt>20nM_488_Day2_04s.asc - CH0</tt>), the evaluation type name together with the internal ID of the evaluation object (e.g. <tt>fcs_fit_1</tt> where <tt>1</tt> is the ID) and an evaluation-dependend suffix (e.g. <tt>fcd_diff1_run0</tt>) . Every column shows the single results (if they are numbers or strings).</li>
<li>average and standard deviation over the currently selected cells will be sidplayed as a second table below the results table.</li>
<li>If a cell contains not a single value or value/error pair it might not be possible to display it in a concise form. Usually vectors/matrices are only displayed directly, if they contain less than 10 elements. If there are more items only the data type name is displayed to save space. If the mouse hovers of a vector/matrix field, the average value and standard deviation of the numbers in the list (if applicable) is shown as a tooltip.</li>
<li><img src=":/lib/refresh16.png"> reloads the results. This may be necessary, when new fit results were produced, but the table was not yet updated with them.</li>
<li><img src=":/lib/delete16.png"> deletes the selected results. You can also click on the top-left corner of the table, which will select all results and then click on <img src=":/lib/delete16.png">. This will delete all results from the current evaluation in the current project.</li>
<li>Many functions are also accessible over the windows main menu and the tables <b>context menu</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Filtering results/Change displayed rows&amp;columns</h3>
<p>The results table can be filtered and modified interactively:<ul>
  <li><a name="#filertable"><a name="filertable"> The <b>evaluation filter</b> allows to interactively filter the columns in the table: If this is non-empty, only rows that match (match means "contains", wildcards * for many characters and ? for a single character are possible) the filter string are displayed. If "RegExp" is activated you may use full <a href="qf3_qtregexp.html">regular expressions</a> instead of the simple wildcards. The <b>and not contains</b> field allows to define a filter, which should NOT be contained in the column name.</li>
  <li>The <b>result filter</b> allows to filter the rows, the same way as the evaluation filter filters the columns. If "RegExp" is activated you may use full <a href="qf3_qtregexp.html">regular expressions</a> instead of the simple wildcards.</li>
  <li>Results may also be in vector or matrix form. For these two display modes are available, which may be changed with the checkbox "<b>show avg+/-SD for vector/matrix results</b>": If it is activated, the average and standard deviation over the full vector/matrix is displayed (in blue and italic). Also the datatype is named in the second line in each cell. If this option is deactivated, only the type name is displayed if more than 10 entries are present. Otherwise the entries are displayed as a list.<br>
$$example:If you only want to display the fit statistics and not the results, you can e.g. enter <i>fit statistics</i> as a result filter. If you're not interested in the fix-columns, which indicate, whether the fit parameter was fixed, you can enter <i>fix</i> in the <b>and not contains</b> field.$$
 </li>
  
</ul></p>


<h3>Export/Print/Copy data</h3>
<p>Most of these functions are found in the context menu of the table. Some are also accessible with buttons above the table. These functions <u>always apply to all cells</u>:
<ul>
  <li> <img src=":/lib/print.png"> <b>Print Table</b> prints the current table</li>
  <li> context-menu: <img src=":/lib/copy16.png"> <b>Copy table as image</b> copies the table as a pixel image/bitmap into the clipboard. You can then paste the table into any image or text processing software.</li>
  <li><img src=":/lib/save16.png"> <b>save all results as file</b> stores the complete table as a data file (e.g. CSV, Excel, Matlab, ...). If any result is a vector or matrix (displayed as a single cell in the table), it is expanded in the file.</li>
  <li><b>Save all results to file, averaged vector/matrix results</b> stores the complete table as a data file (e.g. CSV, Excel, Matlab, ...). If any result is a vector or matrix (displayed as a single cell in the table), only the average and standard dveiation are stored in the file.</li>
</ul>
The following functions apply only to the <u>currently selected cells</u> in the table. If you want to save/copy all cells, you have to select them by clicking on the top-left corner of the table. They are also mostly found in the context menu:
<ul>
    <li><img src=":/lib/copy16valerr.png"> <b>Copy Selection as value+error pairs</b> copies the selected cells as a table into the clipboard. If a result contains an error, two columns are copied and if it is a vector/matrix, the average and standard deciation are calculated.</li>
    <li><img src=":/lib/copy16valerr_nohead.png"> <b>Copy Selection as value+error pairs, w/o header</b> copies the selected cells as a table into the clipboard. If a result contains an error, two columns are copied and if it is a vector/matrix, the average and standard deciation are calculated. This instruction omits the column/row headers, i.e. copies the data only. </li>
    <li><img src=":/lib/copy16valerr.png"> <b>Copy Selection as median+q25+q75</b>  copies the selected cells as a table into the clipboard. If a result is a vector/matrix, the median, the 25% and the 75% quantile are calculated.</li>
    <li><img src=":/lib/copy16valerr_nohead.png"> <b>Copy Selection as median+q25+q75, w/o header</b>  copies the selected cells as a table into the clipboard. If a result is a vector/matrix, the median, the 25% and the 75% quantile are calculated.  This instruction omits the column/row headers, i.e. copies the data only.</li>
    <li><img src=":/lib/copy16.png"> <b>copy in expanded form</b> The functions in this sub-menu expand vector/matrix results to several columns in the copied output<ul>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form</b> copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form (see box at the end of this section!)</li>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form, flipped</b> copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form and rotates the table </li>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form, w/o header</b> copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form, but without row/column headers </li>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form, w/o header, flipped</b> copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form, but without row/column headers and rotates the table </li>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form, to Matlab</b>  copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form into a Matlab script</li>
    <li><b>Copy Selection in expanded form, to Matlab, flipped</b> copies the selected cells as a table in expanded form into a Matlab script </li>
    </ul></li>

$$see:See also the help page on <a href="qf3_fileformats.html">Common Fileformats in QuickFit</a> for informations on some of the different available export formats.$$
$$startbox_info$$
<b>Expanded/Non-Expanded Form</b><br>
The expanded form is a special form of data export, where a cell, which contains multiple values (e.g. because it contains an error for the parameter, or it contains a vector or matrix) is expanded into several columns (or rows in a flipped/rotated table). the following images show the input and output of such an operation in "expanded form":
<center>
<b>Input with parameter error:</b> 
<a name="qf3_evalscreen_pic001"><img src="./pic/qf3_evalscreen_pic001.png" border="1">
<br><b>Output "expanded form":</b>
<img src="./pic/qf3_evalscreen_pic000.png" border="1">
</center>
The same, as above for a cell, containing a matrix
<center><b>Input with parameter matrix:</b> 
<a name="qf3_evalscreen_pic002"><img src="./pic/qf3_evalscreen_pic002.png" border="1">
<br><b>Output "expanded form":</b>
<a name="qf3_evalscreen_pic003"><img src="./pic/qf3_evalscreen_pic003.png" border="1">
</center>

$$endbox$$
</p>

<h3>Result statistics/Plots</h3>
<p>You may view the contents of selected cells as histogram using these functions:<ol>
  <li><img src=":/lib/result_statistics_row.png"> <b>histogram: rows-wise</b> opens a <a href="qfhistogram.html">histogram window</a> that summarizes all selected values (vectors/matrizes are linearized) from each row into one histogram. So if you select the diffusion coefficients of species 1 and 2 from several runs, the window will contain two histograms, one for D1 and one for D2 overlayed. If you select data from several results (e.g. D1 and D2), QuickFit will ask whether to display all histograms in one window or to open one window per result.
   </li>
  <li><img src=":/lib/result_statistics_compare.png"> <b>histogram: cells-wise</b> works the same as above, but does not summarize the data from several runs. This is useful, if you get vectors/matrizes as results, where you want to compare the distributions in each of them. If you select single-number results, no histogram will be displayed, as it makes not much sense for one datapoint only.</li>
  <li><img src=":/lib/result_correlation.png"> <b>Result correlation</b> will take the results in two selected rows and plot them against each other in a <a href="qfparametercorrelation.html">correlation plot</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
