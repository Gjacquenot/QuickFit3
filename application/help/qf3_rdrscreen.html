<p>
This page describes the basic features any raw data record screen implements. 
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_rdr.png"></center>
The screen shows at least three tabs at the top. The button <b><img src=":/help.png"> Help</b> may be used to display this online help message. </p>
<p>In the head-line of this dialog you will find two buttons <img src="./pic/btn_rdr_next.png"> and <img src="./pic/btn_rdr_prev.png"> that allow to move to the next and previous record of the same type. The button <img src="./pic/btn_rdr_removerec.png"> allows to delete the current record from the project. Between the buttons QuickFit displays an icon representing the type of the current record and also its name.</p>

<a name="#properties"><h2>Properties</h2>
<p>The first tab <b>Properties</b> (see image above) may be used to enter these:
<ul>
<li>the <em>internal unique ID</em> (an integer number) of the raw data record</li>
<li>a <em>desciption of the evaluation type</em> </li>
<li>a <em>name</em> for the raw data record (which will also appear in the project tree)</li>
<li>a <em>description text</em>. In the description you may e.g. note how the data was taken, which experiment you did, which instruments you used, ...</li>
<li>a <em>path</em> (with slash '<tt>/</tt>' as separator), which is used to group the records in the project tree. Simply enter a path like "<tt>mypath/subfolder</tt>" and the record will be inside the folders <tt>mypath</tt> and the <tt>subfolder</tt> below the raw data record nodes.</li>
<li>a <em>list of all files</em> associated with the record. Although these files are shown with their absolute path, only relative pathes are saved in the project where possible (e.g. when the files are on the same drive as the project file on a windows system).</li>
<li>a list of <em>properties</em>. A property is key/name (string) together with an arbitrary value (string, integer,floating-point number, boolean) that may e.g. be used to describe some additional information about the record, or the ambient conditions of the experiment, or any metadata, you like. These values are readable by evaluations. You may add a new property using the <img src=":/lib/prop_add.png"> button to add a new property and <img src=":/lib/prop_delete.png"> to remove the selected proeprty. You may edit the property value directly in the table, but note that some properties may be system-properties and are not editable. Any property you added by hand is editable in any case. </li>
</ul>
</p> 
<p> </p>

<a name="#properties"><h2>Evaluation Results</h2>
<p>The second last tab <b>Evaluation Results</b> may be used to view the results of all evaluation objects that were used together with the current raw data record. These results (but only for one evaluation item) are also visible on the <a href="qf3_evalscreen.html">evaluation screen</a>.
      <center><img src="./pic/qf3_rdr_results.png"></center>
Features of the <b>evaluation screen</b> tab:
<ul>
<li>The results are shown as a table, where every column represents the set of results for ONE evaluation. Every column is designated by the evaluation result id, which consists of the raw data record name (e.g. <tt>20nM_488_Day2_04s.asc - CH0</tt>), the evaluation type name together with the internal ID of the evaluation object (e.g. <tt>fcs_fit_1</tt> where <tt>1</tt> is the ID) and an evaluation-dependend suffix (e.g. <tt>fcd_diff1_run0</tt>) . Every row shows the single results (if they are numbers or strings).</li>
<li>average and standard deviation over the currently selected cells will be sidplayed as a second table below the results table.</li>
<li>If a cell contains not a single value or value/error pair it might not be possible to display it in a concise form. Usually vectors/matrices are only displayed directly, if they contain less than 10 elements. If there are more items only the data type name is displayed to save space. If the mouse hovers of a vector/matrix field, the average value and standard deviation of the numbers in the list (if applicable) is shown as a tooltip.</li>
<li>You may select multiple cells in the results table and then <b>copy them to the system clipboard</b>, using the <img src=":/lib/copy16.png"> button. The clipboard contents may be directly pasted into a text editor or a spreadsheet program (e.g. OpenOffice Calc, or Microsoft Excel). The button <img src=":/lib/copy16_nohead.png"> will copy the data only (no header rows/columns). Using the button <img src=":/lib/copy16valerr.png"> instead will also copy the selection, but values and errors are separated into two subsequent rows. This option also copies average and standard deviation of a number list/matrix as value/error.</li>
<li>You may also <b>save the complete table</b>> of results to a data file which is readable by most spreadsheet programs, using the <img src=":/lib/save16.png"> button. </li>
<li>A click on <img src=":/lib/delete16.png"> will remove the currently selected results from the project.</li>
</ul>
