	$$note:You can access this dialog from the main window, by clicking on the menu entry <b>Tools | Project Tools | edit groups, roles and folders</b>.$$
	<p>With this dialog, you can set the groups and roles of all RDRs in the project in an easy and clear manner. The table shows a line for each RDR. In the second and the third column you can edit the group/rolw of the record. </p><p>A role name can be entered freely, although certain specific names (e.g. ACF0, ACF1, FCCS, DCCF, ...) have predefined meaning and are in some cases displayed as a drop-down list. For some records (RDRs) the role should not be edited by the user and the editor widget wil not appear. If you really know what you're doing, you can reactivate the editor widgets by activating the checkbox "role always editable" below the table. This will reactivate the role editor widgets!</p><p>The group names has to be selected from the drop-down list. The last entry in this list alows to add a new group to the project.</p>
	<p>Also the folder can be edit, as described above and the name of the RDRs can be changed, if the check-box "name editable" is checked (default: no).</p>
	<p>In addition to editing each record separately in the table, you can also select several records (keep CTRL pressed and click the records/rows) and set the group/role of all these records at the same time. Whenever two or more rows are selected, the group "set in selected RDRs" below the table will be activated. There you can set a role and/or a group for all selected items. The new role/group will be set, as soon as the button "Set" has been clicked.</p>
