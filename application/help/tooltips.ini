Finally the parameters of all models are optimized simultaneously to best fit all given data sets.</li><li>SImilarly to <i>global optimization</i>, <b>global fit</b> may also refer to a fit algorithm, which finds a global optimum of the objective function. Most fit algorithms (e.g. levenberg marquardt) are local methods that e.g. start at an arbitrary initial point on a the objective function and then follow along its steepest descent, until it finds a valley. Unfortunately this may be a local optimum, which many fit algorithms do not have the capacity to escape. Gloibal fit/optimization algorithms try to avoiud such local minima and instead find a global minimum. This is a problem that often occurs in data fitting, where the fit seems to be stuck to a non-ideal solution, which qualifies as a local minimum to the algorithm. One example of a global optimization algorithm in QUickFit is the <i>simulated annealing</i> algorithm.</li></ol>"

diffusion="<b>Diffusion</b> describes the equilibritazion of a concentration gradient by Brownian random motion (a random walk) of particles in a fluid/gas.

$[ \\mat{\\Sigma}=\\left(\\mat{J}^\\mathrm{T}\\mat{J}\\right)^{-1},\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (*) ]$ 
where the matrix $(\\mat{J})$ is the Jacobian of the (weighted) least-squares problem (usually evaluated with numerical derivatives) for the dataset $( (\\tau_i,\\hat{g}_i,\\sigma_i)_i)$ and the model $(g(\\tau,\\vec{\\beta}))$, which is parametrized by a parameter vector $(\\vec{\\beta}\\in\\mathbb{R}^p)$:

For a non-weighted least-squares problem (i.e. $(\\sigma_i=1\\ \\forall\\ i)$), the variance-covariance matrix (*) is given instead by:
$[ \\mat{\\Sigma}=\\frac{\\chi^2}{N-p}\\cdot\\left(\\mat{J}^\\mathrm{T}\\mat{J}\\right)^{-1}, ]$ 
where $(N)$ is the number of datapoints, $(p)$ the number of fit parameters and $(\\chi^2)$ the residual sum of squares (see above). In both cases, the <b>error of a fit parameter</b> $(\\beta_i)$ is finally calculated as: 
$[\\mbox{err}(\\beta_i)=\\sqrt{\\mat{\\Sigma}_{ii}}]$"
