RDREDITOR="The <b>raw data record</b> editor allows to view and change the contents of a raw data record (RDR). You can open the editor of any raw data record by double-clicking its entry in the project tree in the main window. The raw data record editor also allows to edit the RDR properties and results."

project="QuickFit organizes data in projects, which may each contain a set of raw data records (RDRs) and a set of evaluation objects, which evaluate the data present in the RDRs."
RDRPROPERTIES="Each raw data record (RDR) has several properties, describing it. Some of the are general to all:<ul><li>name</li><li>RDR group</li><li>RDR folder</li><li>RDR description text</li></ul> and some are custom.

RDRROLE="Each raw data record (RDR) has a role, which specifies, which data it represents, if the data type is ambiguous. An example are RDRs from an FCCS measurement: The same type of RDR is used for the different auto- and cross-correlation fucntions of the measurement (one RDR for each type of correlation). The role then distinguished them, e.g. as ACF0/ACF1 for the autocorrelations and FCCS fro the cross-correlation."

RDRGROUP="Each raw data record (RDR) has a group property, which allows to represent a link between several RDRs (e.g. all RDRs, generated from the same imFCS measurement will belong to the same group, or all RDRs reprresenting one of the correlation curves from a single FCCS measurement). The group is represented as a background color of the RDRs in the project tree of QuickFit (same gray-level=same group) and can be edited on the first tab of the RDR editor, or with the tools in the <tt>Tools|Project Tools</tt> menu. Evaluation plugins may use the information stored in the RDR group and RDR role to recognize linked RDRs."
RDR group=%RDRGROUP
evaluation="An <b>evaluation</b> is an object of the project, which takes the data stored in raw data records (RDRs) as input and processes it (e.g. it fits a function to the data). the results are typically stored as RDR results in the RDR."
RDR results="results of an evaluation in QuickFit are generally stored as fit result with the RDR they were created from. All results are accessible in the RDR editor (last tab) and are grouped as a table, where each column groups the results from one evaluation object."
RDRFOLDER="Each raw data record (RDR) may be put into a folder. Simply edit the folder name in the RDR editor (use slashed <tt>/</tt> as path separators) and the RDR will appear in this folder in the project. Folders are used to isually group RDRs in the project. To specify a link between records, it is advised to also use RDR groups (represented as different gray levels in the project tree)."

FITALGORITHM="An algorithm, which fits a fitting model function $$math:f(x,\\vec{p})$$ to a set of measured datapoints <i>(x_i, f_i)</i>. During this fitting, it optimizes the function parameters $$math:\\vec{p}$$. Usually the least squares between the data and the model, i.e. $$math:\\sum_{i=1}^N(f(x_i,\\vec{p})-f_i)^2$$ is minimized."
FITFUNCTION="A model function, that is used to describe a measurement. Usually a fitting function depends on a set of parameters $$math:\\vec{p}$$, which can be optimized, so the function ideally fits a given set of measurements."

GLOBALFIT="Usually, in a fit, the parameters of a single model are optimized to best describe a single measurement. In a <b>global fit</b> this is extended to several models for several measurements. The parameters of these models may partly be linked, as the same parameter describes several of the measurements. Finally the parameters of all models are optimized simultaneously to best fit all given data sets."
