<p>QuickFit 3 is in itself not a fitting application (as the name may suggest), but more or less just a data manager. It is based on a very simple and versatile data model:
<ol>
<li>All data is organized in projects (QFProject) and at every time one project is loaded in QuickFit. A project is saved in a XML file which describes the object inside the project. Usually it does not contain the raw data (although saving data to the project is possible).</li>
<li>There are only few basic types of objects in a project:
 <ul>
   <li>a raw data record (QFRawDataRecord) which represents any type of data. There is no interface to the data that you HAVE to use, so a raw data record may represent any data type (an image, a dataseries, a curve, single values, a table, an image series, ...). There are only some basic properties for each data object implemented, that are general enough to be used by any object: a name, a description, a list of files (which you do not have to use) and a set of properties (<key, value> pairs). There is also an API to store evaluation results in this raw data record.</li>
   <li>data evaluations (QFEvaluationItem) which work on one or more data objects from the list of raw data records. The results may either be saved in the evaluation, or written back to the raw data record.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>In addition QuickFit implements additional possibilities to also use it in a more versatile sense (like e.g. as basis for instrument control applications, where the measurement results are directly stored in a QuickFit project. To do so, a very basic plugin interface is provided that allows to extend QuickFit with plugins that do not implement a special functionality (like e.g. raw data records or evaluations), but that mainly only may provide buttons or menu entries in the main application that amy be bound to any type of function.</p>
